            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2304:3"/> ghoſt in the canonicall Scriptures, to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall combate and warfaire. Of which as the written vvord it ſelfe, in the ſound doctrine, and approoued examples thereof, concerning this point, doth beare faithfull witnes; ſo, if god would giue vs grace, carefullie to obſerue, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other men, or our ſelues, in ſuch ſorte as vve ought, or could not but quicklie finde good warrantiſe for it, in the vvorld likewiſe. For confirmation whereof, if vve had no more, but on the other ſide, the darke doctrine of poperie, euerie vvhere aſſaying to perſvvade, yea to driue men to doubting, and on the other ſide, the diffidence and diſtruſtfulneſſe, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we carrie about with vs in our hearts, it were as a man might ſay more then ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Touching the popiſh opinion, it is certainelie pitifull, that they can ſee no other vvaye or meane to preuent proude preſumption, but to incurre the daunger of diſtruſt and doubting. And it is the more pitifull doubtleſſe, by hovv much, both in Gods religion, yea and in mans reaſon alſo they can not but know &amp; confeſſe, that euery ſingular vertue or good worke, hath
<pb facs="tcp:2304:3"/> two ſins ſet againſt it, the one as diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, the other as contrarie to it. The vertue or good worke as we nowe call it here is truſt in God then what can be a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vvorke, ſith our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>This is the worke of Chriſt that ye beleeue in him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath ſent?</hi> And vvhat is more contrarie to it then to doubt or diſtruſt? and vvhat is more diſagreeing from it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lucifer-like preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet euen againe I ſay, it is the more pitifull by howe much it croſſeth, euen their ovvne opinion &amp; practiſe. For how can that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of theirs touching merit before Chriſt and ſpecially of meriting eternall life, ſtand with the doctrine of doubting, ſeeing that merite, or abſolute obedience, ſpecially if men deale with one that is iuſt, as Chriſt (who is iuſtice it ſelfe) muſt needes ſhutt out doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting touching that we are ſure we haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and he cannot chooſe but of iuſtice giue and graunt. But ſuch vaine fanteſies muſt they fall into, that fall avvaie from the faith and trueth of the worde, and vvill lift vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Chriſt our Sauiour, that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing grace offered, and feeling it where it is
<pb facs="tcp:2304:4"/> not to bee found, they might vaniſh avvay, through the diſquietnes of their ſpirits, in the vaine imaginations of their ovvne mindes. Concerning the other: it is verie lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in ſo large aboundance of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, and in ſo faithfull and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall performance of them, ſpeciallie to his owne people (whereof not onely the vvord, but the vvorld, doth yeeld vs an infinite cloude of vvitneſſes) mens mindes ſhould yet be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, vvith fearefulneſſe and doubting. But ſuch, and ſo great, is Sathans malice againſt vs, and ſo dull and ſlow of heart are vve to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, ſpeciallie when we regard our manifold vnworthineſſe, our grieuous tranſgreſſions, or the ſeueritie and iuſtice of the Lords iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it is more then marueilous, if anie man be found in better eſtate, conſidering I ſay, either vvhat we are by nature, or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall, what after our inlighting and regeneration begunne in vs, a world there is of reliques &amp; remainder of corruption in vs: which though they doe not vtterly deface and put out the good worke of God in vs, becauſe it
<pb facs="tcp:2304:4"/> is to maieſticall and povverfull, to be battered and beaten downe, by ſo weake an aduerſarie, yet do they ſo backward and hinder the ſame, that in this life vvee can not attaine to that fulneſſe of faith, which we greatly hunger and thirſt after: and though through gods goodnes, we haue gained ſomewhat, yet many times we finde thoſe graces ſo eclipſed and darkened in vs, that they ſeeme to be as if they vvere not. But what meane we to trauaile in the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thning of theſe points vvhich in euerye mans minde and mouth almoſt, are ſo cleare and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, as nothing more. The thing rather that we ſhould ſtriue vnto, is this, namely that ſith by corrupt opinions, we are or may be dayly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted outwardly, and by Sathans ſubtle ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and our owne curſed corruptions, vve are continually prouoked inwardly, as to euerie other euill generally, ſo particularly to this ſore ſickneſſe of our ſoules, diſtruſt or doubting, we ſhould in the holy wiſedome &amp; cleare light of Gods vvorde, and alſo by the all ſufficient ſtrength and power of the bleſſed ſpirite, ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to looke vnto our ſelues, as that we ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:2304:5"/> not our ſelues, either to be infected vvith the pleaſaunt poyſon of falſe doctrine, or to bee drawne to diſcomfort, through the doubtfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our hearts. For as the former hazer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth (what ſaie I nay ouerthroweth the health of our ſoules, &amp; that more dangerouſly by much then any bodily poiſon doth or can doe, the ſtate of our outward man, for in the middeſt of this, the minde may be ſafe and ſure, whereas in the other, ſpecially perſiſted in there inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euerlaſting deſtruction both of bodie and ſoule: ſo the latter ſtrongly haleth downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, and violently bringeth vnto vs, all heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart and fearefull diſquitneſſe, and togeather with the ſame as a peculiar effect thereof, all manner of vnwillingneſſe, vnfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and diſabilitie in and about the ſeruice of Chriſt, whether publikely in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or priuately in the familie: as alſo for the carefull accompliſhment of our Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties either at home or abroad. For what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood or probability is there that he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before god, or doe good vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe ſpirit is diſquieted within him: ſeeing that a
<pb facs="tcp:2304:5"/> quiet ſpirit is a thing much ſet by before god, and fitteth vs alſo for naturall duties? Theſe great difcfiulties &amp; dangers, are not, nay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcerned, but by the light of the word: neither indeede can the euill of them, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented and beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe, but by carefull taking vnto vs, and dailie vſing of, all the armour that Chriſt himſelfe, and not man hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for vs, and preſcribed vnto vs in the worde of trueth. For plaine proofe whereof we may beholde (if we can) the bad effects and bitter fruits, that either the ignorance or neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect hereof bringeth forth in our age. And if there were no more but this, the continuall carnalitie and carnall ſecuritie, that euerie where raigneth, til it be diſcouered and felt, and the diſtruſt yea deſperation, that then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, when the Lord is pleaſed to lay it open, and to preſſe it hard and home, as we ſaie, to to the heart, theſe were ſufficient enough not onely to prooue the point, but alſo to cauſe vs in time to leaue our great and grieuous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and in in a good and acceptable ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen while it is called to day, as the ſcripture
<pb facs="tcp:2304:6"/> ſaieth, to looke to better courſes, aſſuring our ſelues, that as for poperie, it can neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled but by the ſounde knovvledge of Gods will reuealed in his vvord, this trueth beeing as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that errour and falſehood as daye is to darkneſſe: and as for aſſured comforte in diſtreſſe or diſtruſt, it is no where to be found, but generally in the ſame word alſo, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the ſweet promiſes thereof, which as God alone, that is altogether faithfull, hath plentifullye made, ſo vvill he, that is onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, and doth vvhatſoeuer pleaſeth him both in heauen and earth, in an acceptable time graciouſly performe, for his glorie, and the good of his people. And that therefore vve ſhould endeuour, by all the good meanes that poſſibly we can, that the word of Chriſt might dvvell in vs plenteouſly, in all vviſedome, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and admoniſhing our ovvne ſelues, in Pſalmes and Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongues, ſinging with a grace in our hearts to the Lord, and doing vvhat ſoeuer vve ſhall do in vvord or in deede, either towards God in the cauſe of his vvorſhip, or in the dueties of charitie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards

               </gap>e of my ſelfe and others, onely to ſupplant corruption an vntruth, but alſo to defend that truth that God hath propounded in his word, and we heare ſounded in our Churches, namely that euery faithfull man ought to be certenly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his free iuſtification, and euerlaſting ſaluation through Chriſt. And herein I haue purpoſed, and mind through Gods goodnes to performe and obſerue this order follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is firſt to anſwere, whatſoeuer they ſay and obiect againſt this truth. And then afterwards to ratifie and confirme it. And this I take to be neceſſarie, not onely becauſe our aduerſaries forces being weakened yea
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2304:11"/> vtterly ouerthrown, our own may be found to be the more ſtrong, and better able to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the day of a newe aſſault, if euer the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſhould dare to attempt the giuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but alſo becauſe euill and corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt remooued out of the heads &amp; hearts of men, the truth tendered might finde the better entertainment there.

               </gap>e purpoſeth to ſow or ſet there. So muſt we doe then, when we offer or mind to make fruitful in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mindes the ſeede of the truth and word of God, not onely doing what we can to remooue and take away the naturall blindeneſſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God and good things, that is in men, yea and that ſame ſeede of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and hereſie, that Satan by himſelfe and his ſuppoſts in malice againſt God and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe towards men, hath caſt and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, but alſo to plant &amp; cauſe to thriue the word of truth and life.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:2304:11"/>
            <p>All our aduerſaries arguments are drawne either from diuine authoritie, as the holy ſcriptures and word of God foulie wreſted and miſvnderſtood, as when we come to the handling of the places which they obiect, ſhall I doubt not through Gods goodnes plainely appeare, or els fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humane teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and reaſon, of which ſure we need make no great reckoning, not onely becauſe they are as eaſily reiected as alleadged, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we acknowledge no other obiect or ground of our conſciences to ſtay ourſelues vpon, but the holy ſcriptures or writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God. And therefore ſauing that we would haue all to vnderſtand, yea euen the very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelues, that they are not able for the defence of falſhood, through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan, and their owne corruption to alleadge any thing which through the grace of God ſhed abroad into our hearts, and the light of truth vouchſafed vnto vs, we are not able both plainely to diſcrie and ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute we might let al that paſſe without any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of touch at all. we wil begin firſt with thoſe things they alleadge out of ſcriptures
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2304:12"/> becauſe they onely indeed are materiall: &amp; ſo afterwards come to humane authorities. Nowe becauſe the ſcriptures of God, are not vnrightly deuided into the old and newe Teſtament, and they alleadge ſomewhat out of both, for the maintenance of this corrupt point, we will firſt anſwere the places of the old Teſtament, and after of the newe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Places out of the old Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They commonly alleadge from thence, ſuch places as ſpeaking of heauenly matters, and particularly of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, do vſe tearmes of doubting, &amp; ſeeme doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to promiſe fauoure to penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſons. Amongſt whcih I remember not that they haue alleadged any more: then 2. Samuel. 16.12. Amos 5.15. Ioel 2.14. Ion. 3.9. Sauing that they haue produced a place out of Daniel. 4. ver. 24. where indeede in the greeke text, &amp; in Ieroms latine tranſlation, there is vſed a article of doubting, as <hi>perhaps,</hi> or <hi>it may be, there willbe a healing of thy ſinnes.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the word that the Prophet vſeth doth in the hebrewe ſignifie rather a manifeſt aſſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or affirmation, as though he ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2304:12"/> ſay, loe, there ſhall be an healing of thine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. This not onely agreeing better with the Prophets purpoſe, which as it was in the firſt part of the verſe to inſtruct the king by holy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, to breake off his ſinnes through righteouſnes, his iniquities by ſhewing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to the afflicted: ſo in this part, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that that was preſcribed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to comfort him. This alſo being an vſual thing in duties of obedience, and holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts deliuered, to adioyne ſweete and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promiſes, that ſo they might ſee their labour and loue in the Lord ſhould not be loſt. Neither may we thinke the Prophet, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ignorant of this in himſelfe, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to propound it to others, that vpon obedience of Gods will and ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, men ſhould certenly finde fauour with the Lord, which he might haue called into queſtion, if he ſhould haue ſpoken ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But les vs graunt that the words were commonly, or for the moſt part vſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe doubting or diſtruſt, wil this followe therevpon that they would faine inferre, namely that therefore Gods children ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2304:13"/> doubt of the forgiuenes of their ſinnes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. Nay, for firſt it is not cleare and certen, whether Nabuchadnezer, to whome theſe words were directed, were an elected chlid of God yea or no: and we knowe that the queſtion concerneth them that are called and iuſtified and ſanctified in ſome meaſure and ſo ſhall be eternally ſaued. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides whether can we tell that that which was in him of terrour and feare, were ſound or hypocriticall: or whether he continued, or whether Daniel, hauing extraordinary and many perſonall things alſo reuealed vnto him, foreſawe what ſhould become of him. In ſuch caſes we ſee, and to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons many things may be deliuered as if it were doubtingly, whereas with perſons of other qualities and callings, other courſes muſt be obſerued. But put the hardeſt, we haue yet another aunſweare vnto this place namely that the Prophet vſeth this manner of ſpeach, both to note the difficultie and the excellencie of the things he required at the kings hands, men imagining, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance conuerting to God, taking away
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2304:13"/> of ſinnes, &amp;c. to be a very eaſie and ſleight matter, which indeede cauſeth them not to eſteeme, the grace according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe thereof, nor to ſtriue therevnto as they ſhould: and alſo to cauſe him, and in him all others the more to indeauoure. the attaining thereof, and ſtrengthening of themſelues therein, becauſe things ſo hardly atcheiued and of ſuch dignity indeed, would not be ſleightely or lightly let goe. And let this ſuffice or ſatisfie for this place. Let vs come to the reſt already quoted, and examine them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt place is the 2. Sammuel 16.12. <hi>It may be that the Lord will looke on mine affliction: and doe me good for his curſing this day.</hi> They are the wordes of Dauid to Abiſhai, who would very willingly haue ſlaine Shimei rayling vpon the king his maſter, and nowe flying from the face of his ſonne Abſhalon where vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and beſides that that hath bin ſaid before, touching the place of Daniel, we may adde this: it is hard vpon all the wordes of good men, to inferre either the lawefulneſſe of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2304:14"/> their ſpeaches, or a doctrine either contrary to the truth of the word in other places, or not warranted thereby. For as that is true in Salomon, that <hi>where there are many vvords there is much ſinne,</hi> ſo that is likewiſe true that the Apoſtle Iames ſaith, <hi>he is a iuſt man that hath not offended with his tongue.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times feare, griefe, haſtines, hatred, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue, and other paſsions carrie them very farre, as we may perceiue not onely in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid himſelfe, but in ſundry other of Gods children, as Ieremy. <hi>Woe is me my mother, &amp;c.</hi> chap. 15. 10. and Peter <hi>M. fauour or be good vnto thy ſelfe.</hi> Math. 16. Laſtly he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here but of an outward mercie, of which many a good man conſidering his owne vnworthineſſe, and how they are but promiſed vpon condition may eaſily doubt, and yet offer no iniury to Gods grace, for he giueth theſe things as pleaſeth him indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to the good and the badde, nor much diſcomfort to his owne heart. And what is this to ſpirituall &amp; heauenly geaces? all which as they do proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the free fauour of god toward vs in Ieſus Chriſt, ſo are they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2304:14"/> vnto vs, and propounded vnto vs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and without condition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they nowe aſſured in themſelues &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the more hope vnto the hearts of the faithfull. And if there be a condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, as I deny not but ſometimes there is, it is but for the better ſtrengthening of vs therein, whileſt that he that promiſeth vs, giueth vs ſtrength to performe the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and condition, and ſo both we in his grace haue the more certaine aſſurance, and he might the more plainely and fully crowne his owne graces in vs.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The next place is Amos 5.15. <hi>Hate the euill and loue the good, and eſtabliſh iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the gate: it may the Lord God of Hoſtes will be mercifull to the remnant of Ioſeph.</hi> which place though it may in ſome ſort be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that which is put downe already if men will well viewe and marke that which hath beene deliuered, yet it ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to adde ſome particular thing for the further declaration and explanation thereof. The Prophet had to deale, with a ſtraunge kinde of people, not onely ſuch as were giuen
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2304:15"/> ouer to idolatrie, and other particular iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hatred of the Prophets; oppresſing of the poore, &amp;c. But ſuch as yet notwithſtanding iuſtified themſelues, and ſaid that the Lord of hoſts was with them. No doubt but they that were thus exalted in themſelues and that without anie cauſe had neede by all good meanes to be humbled. And they that were thus hypocriticall not onely to deceiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but to dallie with their owne hearts, and to thinke that God and iniquitie could ſtand well together, had need to be ſent back, &amp; to be inſtructed, to ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their owne ſoules well. And that cauſeth the Prophet to deale with them as he doth in this place. But what is this to gods people, who through his grace are reſtrained from theſe high and hainous iniquities? &amp; who are ſo farre of from decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their owne hearts, in a vaine imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that notwithſtanding their ſinne God is preſent with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſtoong with ſinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and feeling the wrath of God againſt them for the ſame, they feare he will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them for euer. Yea manie times they doe not onely thinke it, which is verie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2304:15"/> grieuous to their owne hearts, but ſpeake it alſo which is grieuous to other of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to heare, as we may perceiue by manie of Gods Saints &amp; particularly by Dauid, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie Pſalmes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The other two places of Ioel. 2.14. &amp; of Ionah. 3.9. are for phraſe &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpeach both one, &amp; may be ſufficiently both cleared &amp; anſwered by that which hath bin ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Howbeit it ſhall not be amiſſe in a word as it were to giue them their ſeuerall anſwers alſo. Though the phraſe and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpeach as hath bin ſaid before be all one, yet we ſhall perceiue the perſons of or to whome theſe ſpeaches are deliuered, as alſo who haue vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to differ much. For that that is in Ioel are the words of the Prophet pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the ſpirit of God &amp; are not deliuered, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare either that God himſelfe doubted of his owne work, &amp; did not foreknow &amp; ſoreap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what ſhould become of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, almighty, alknowing, &amp;c. and no ſuch thing as doubting can fall into his nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is euerie way abſolutely good: or as though the Prophet were not perſwaded of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2304:16"/> this, that they turning from their euill waies, God would returne againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in loue, and remooue the euill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced for he knewe and beleeued, that all the threats of God were denounced vnder that condition: but hauing to deale with a people, as of a hollowe &amp; hypocritical heart, yea of a hard hart, and ſuch as were froſen vpon the lees and dregges of their owne ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and yet would make ſemblance and ſhewe as though they would repent, he ſpeaketh this, not ſo much to worke doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords loue towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their vnfained ſubmisſion, and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, as to let them vnderſtand that there is in this behalfe no halting or dalying with the Lord, and that it is no ſmale meaſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion indeede, that in themſelues muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues, of the taking away of the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that were vpon them, and of the continuance of Gods fauour for the reſt of the time to come, he rather by this forme and phraſe, ſhewing them what they ſhould doe, &amp; moouing them by the difficulty and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of the thing, to reare vp their hearts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2304:16"/> to the hope of Gods grace and promiſes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtirring them vp to any manner of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and diſtruſt. The wordes in Ionah are not Ionahs owne wordes, which maketh the caſe ſomewhat more weake, becauſe the wordes of a Prophet, ſpecially when he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as God and from God are more to be eſteemed then other mens wordes: but the ſpeeches of the king of Niniuie his Nobles and Councell: who whether they were true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched yea or no and ſo continued is not certen, or whether ceaſed for the time with the feare of iudgement, as many hypocrites are and may be, and we ſee it particularly in Ahab (whoſe hypocriticall repentance God was pleaſed to reward, with withholding the iudgements from him in his time, as wel as he did from the Ninivites then) did relent a little which is moſt likely. But from their ſpeeches, that were no better graced, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo in the feare &amp; feeling of Gods wrath againſt them for their heinous ſinnes, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubtfulneſſe and diſtruſt in the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, is not to gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thiſtles, which alſo is impoſible, but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2304:17"/> euen to fetch like from like, yea and if it were poſsible, from good and ſound trees, ſuch as it may be, the Ninivites were (but alwaies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that I minde not now to determine the queſtion one way or other) to gather bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thornes, brambles, &amp; ſuch other noiſome and hurtfull things. And this much both for all the places of Scripture, that ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubtful phraſes &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and for theſe particulars, which in that reſpect they alledge. Now we come to more ſpeciall &amp; ſeuerall places of the old teſtament. 4 They alleadge a place out of the 9. of Iob, and as I take it the 21. verſe, and that after this manner, out of their olde latin tranſlation as I ſuppoſe. <hi>Though I ſhould be ſimple: my ſoule ſhall be ignorant of this matter.</hi> Wherein firſt we blame them for their badde tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it is thus in the originall. <hi>I am vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right or perfect, I knovv not my ſoule, &amp;c.</hi> Where wee are to marke, that when Iob ſpeaketh of his vprightneſſe or perfection, he meaneth it not as in regard of God, for he had ſaide but in the next verſe before this. <hi>If I vvould iustifie my ſelfe, mine ovvne
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2304:17"/> mouth ſhould condemne me, &amp;c.</hi> but as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them that preſſed him ſo ſore, and as in reſpect of his owne defence, for he was free from thoſe ſinnes and offences, which they ſaide he was afflicted for. And when he ſaith, <hi>he knovveth not his ſoule,</hi> he meaneth thereby that notwithſtanding he were from fault &amp; offence as in regard of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he was well aſſured of this, that as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God he was a very grieuous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour, yea that there lay lurking within him, as he knew full well by the teſtimonie of his owne heart, many great iniquities, which the Prophet Dauid calleth, pſal. 19. <hi>ſecret faults:</hi> not that they were hidden from God, for his eies ſee all things, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue to doe: neither yet becauſe they were kept cloſe from men. For ſo many times God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth for his glorie, and the good not onely of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that offend, whilſt they are not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſhame, but of others alſo who by that meanes doe not ſo eaſily ſlippe and ſlide, as perhaps otherwiſe they would, but becauſe alſo they were committed, and yet either he knew them nor, or could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2304:18"/> them. Surely Iobe meant nothing els but to ſhewe, that our ſaluation, hope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, &amp;c. ſtood not in our ſelues, but in the free mercy and fauour of God toward vs in Ieſus Chriſt, which as it may appeare by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry circumſtances and words in that chapter, and namely verſe 20. before alleadged, ſo it will more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly breake forth by the ſcope and drift of the holy mans ſpeech: which that we may the better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. we are to mark both what Bildad obiected againſt him chap 8. and what he anſweareth thereto in this &amp; the next chapter following. Bildad aſſaied to prooue, that the afflictions which were laid vpon Iob, were inflicted vpon him for his owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of his ſonnes. This Iob willingly graunteth, as appeareth in the 2 verſe of this 9 chapter. But yet ſaith he, <hi>what man is iuſt before God?</hi> And this maketh him to ſay verſe 3. <hi>that no man is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere him one for a thouſand.</hi> And againe verſe 15. <hi>Though I were iuſt yet could I not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but I would make ſupplication to my iudge.</hi> And what is this els, but that others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him haue acknowledged euery where,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2304:18"/> Dauid Pſal 143. <hi>Enter not into iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with thy ſeruant, for in thy ſight ſhall none that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth be iuſtified.</hi> And Paul. <hi>Though I knowe nothing by my ſelfe, yet I am not for all that iustified before God.</hi> And ſo he declareth that iuſt and holy men, muſt altogeather diſtruſt their owne righteouſnes, as which can yeeld them no other comfort almoſt, but doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſtruſt, and rely vpon Gods grace onely, and by that euen to lift vp themſelues againſt the iudgement of God, knoweing that euen here that is true which Saint Iames ſaith, <hi>mercie reioyceth against conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> But ſuppoſe this were not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and that that tranſlation of theirs were true and right, yet me thinketh that ſhould make little or nothing for them in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. For they can conclude nothing vpon it, but this at the vttermoſt, namely that Iob complained, that though he were innocent yet his ſoule felt not it, becauſe it was as it were rent in ſunder, and ouerthrowne with the ſcourges of God. And though we ſhould, graunt, that the place were to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Iobs innocency in it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2304:19"/> reſpect or compariſon, and namely of this that by reaſon of the hardnes of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſore chaſtiſment: he could not feele it, yet will it not helpe them, for no man can certenly ſay, that he is altogether innocent, ſith no fleſh liuing is without ſinne, but euery one transgreſſeth, and as it is ſaid in the epiſtle of S. Iames, <hi>in many things we offend all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 An other place they bring out of Pet. 28. verſe 14. where it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway.</hi> Where firſt we ſay that feare and doubting differ, and that not onely as in regard of name &amp; title, but as in reſpect of effect alſo: for doubting breedeth diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, as one vice ingendreth another: whereas feare worketh care, circumſpection reuerence, and many other good things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. And therefore it is il done thus to wreſt the ſcripture, and to labour to make it to ſpeake that, which neither the words as we haue heard already, or the ſenſe which we heare anone will beare. Nowe for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I doubt not but Salomon in this place meaneth the feare, that we commonly call filiall, childlike, or ſuch as is or ſhould be in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2304:19"/> children towards their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which beſides that it hath adioyned with it a reuerent loue, &amp; louing reuerence towards their fathers mothers &amp;c. it worketh alſo in them careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not ſo much to do the good things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned them for ſo it may be they lacke abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and power as to avoide indeede the euill things their parents haue forbidden them, &amp; they know will diſpleaſe them. And becauſe God is our heauenly father and farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth al earthly freindes and parents whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I doubt not, but euen the ſame is meant here towards God, yea there is as a man may ſay commanded to be in vs, a feare acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and feeling Gods iudgement and wrath againſt ſinne, and working deſire, care and watchfulneſſe, to ſhunne all corruption either in religion or in conuerſation, becauſe with ſuch things God is highly diſpleaſed. And for as much as there are two common faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s amongſt other, in the corrupted heart of all Adams poſteritie, the firſt is carefulnes and ſecurity, by which men are drawne, to make ſmale account, if not to contemne, the wrath and diſpleaſure of almightie God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2304:20"/> ſinne. And the ſecond is pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, thruſting men forward not onely beyond the bonds of their places and callings, but euen into confidence of their owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, righteouſnes, &amp;c. both which ſinnes bring forth this bitter effect, that gods iudgements, are little or no whit at all regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as we may ſee in Phatao, and his ſecure and proud people, I doubt not but that the ſpirit alſo commending vnto vs in this holy ſentence, the reuerence and feare of almighty God, went about therein euen to expreſſe theſe as other ſinnes. By which we may ſee that this muſt needes be the meaning of the place, namely that we ſhould alwaies carry about with vs, a holy and continuall care, watchfulnes, yea and if we will feare, that we ſinne not or offend againſt God, nor in any reſpect if we can faile in our duties, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God or towards our neighbours, or towardes our ſelues: as though Salomon ſhould ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that feareth much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> For ſo much I thinke vvill the text itſelfe beare, both in the wordes of it, and in the coniugation that the verbe is vſed in to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2304:20"/> witt that he ſinne not or offend againſt God, and his holy commaundements: and that leaſt he ſhould be forſaken, and caſt away from God. And me thinketh I haue two reaſons, of this ſenſe. The one from the word it ſelfe turned here feare, which doth not onely ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie feare of euill, whether it be the euill of puniſhment or of ſinne, but alſo to feare with reuerence, and that not onely of the thing or partie feared, but alſo as in regard of him that doth feare: he beeing drawne thereinto, not onely by the duetie he oweth as in regard of his owne baſe and weake eſtate, but euen as in reſpect of the reuerence and excellencie of him before whome he trembleth. And from hence is it that Geneſ. 31. ver. 42. <hi>God is called the feare of Izhak.</hi> The ſecond from things proceeding or going before in the text, and alſo from the latter part of this verſe it ſelfe. He had ſaid in the verſe next and immediatly going before this: <hi>he that couereth his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresſions ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his ſinnes, and forſaketh them ſhall finde mercie:</hi> and thereunto he adioyneth this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>bleſſed is the man that feareth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2304:21"/> As though he ſhould ſay. He that by a godly feare is drawne to the vnfeined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesſion of his ſinnes, and to the loathing and leauing of the ſame and by loathing of them to ſincere repentance, is in a happie and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate, though perhaps his owne heart for the time preſent, or men of the world conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually will neuer thinke ſo, yet bleſſed and happie muſt he be, becauſe God hath ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it. In the words following he ſaith, <hi>but he that hardeneth his hart ſhall fall into euill.</hi> We know this is vſuall in theſe prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall ſentences, that one of them is oppoſite to another. When therefore he had ſaid, <hi>bleſſed is he that feareth much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually,</hi> &amp; by &amp; by addeth, <hi>but he that hardeneth his heart &amp;c.</hi> he plainly declareth, that in the firſt part of the verſe he mindeth to commend &amp; ſet out ſuch a feare of offending and diſpleaſing god, as is oppoſite to hardnes of hart, contemning god, wherfore doubtles he mindeth to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſecure &amp; proud perſons, ſuch I meane, as not beeing mooued, neither by gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, nor threatnings, lay the raines in their owne necks &amp; follow their pleaſures
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2304:21"/> ſhall ſurely fall into wrath and puniſhment: wheras on the other ſide they ſhall haue good ſucceſſe, that feare god, and are loth wittingly on willingly as we ſay, to offend and diſpleaſe him. And this I take to be not onely the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ſentence here: but almoſt in euery place of the word, where it is ſaid. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth that Lord.</hi> Where alſo we are to know further, that ſuch ſentences are propounded vnto vs, not to ſtrike doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes or diſtruſt into the hearts of beleeuers, which beeing in them naturally, &amp; through the remainders of ſinne God laboureth by ſo many meanes to remoue from them, as the promiſes of the word, the participation of his Sacraments, the pledge &amp; powerful working of his ſpirite &amp;c. For ſo god in his words and deeds ſhould be contrary to himſelfe: and we muſt ſo expound his word as we find no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradition in the places themſelues, nor loade him with any oppoſition, who in his owne nature &amp; in his word alſo is alwayes but one. But in them that ſetting before their eyes, on the one ſide, their owne weaknes and wants and on the other ſide the good that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2304:22"/> of them, they might not onely depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wholy of his mercy, and no way ſwell with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of any gift that they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but alſo ſtriue according to the meaſure of grace vouchſafed vnto them, to doe that that the Lord requireth at their hands. And what will this ſerue to vphold doubtfullnes or diſtruſt of hart in Gods children?</p>
            <p n="6">6 The laſt place that they alleadge out of the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which hath any marrow or ſtrength in it, is in Eccleſiaſtes or the booke of the preacher cha. 9. ver. 1. which they turn and expound after this manner. <hi>Man knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, whether he be worthie loue or hatred,</hi> that is to ſay in the popiſh la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, &amp; as they interpret it, whether he be in the grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God yea or no. Where firſt we may not diſſemble this, that as in other places ſo here, they diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the original verity, both in their tranſlation &amp; in their ſenſe. For theſe words are in Hebrew thus. <hi>Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or either, loue, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or either hatred, knoweth not ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: al which is before their faces.</hi> VVhereas we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in their tranſlation they adde the word worthie, which is not there to be found: and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2304:22"/> in their interpretation or ſenſe they add God and his fauour or hatred, there beeing not in this part of the text any of the names wherby god is called in the old Teſtament. But before we come to deliuer that which we take to be the true meaning of the ſpirite here, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that euen the text as they turne it, will not euince that, for which they aleadge it. For though we ſhould graunt them, that loue and hatred ſhould in this place be vnderſtood of gods loue &amp; hatred towards men, yet this me thinketh we may ſay of it, namely that wee muſt needs vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it either of men that are ignorant of Gods word and vnbeleeuers or elſe of his loue and hatred towards ſuch, as of whoſe faith we doubt not: for betwene theſe two there is no meane, neither are there anie other ſorts of people in the world. To refer it to the incredulous, &amp; to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it of them, there is no reaſon. Becauſe he that cannot lie hath told vs, <hi>he that beleeueth not is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned already,</hi> becauſe he beleeueth not in the name of the onely ſonne of god: &amp; ſith he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we iudge not according to our ſelues, but according to his truth that cannot
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2304:23"/> erre. And beſids he that beleueth not the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as he knoweth not god himſelfe with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and fruite: ſo he knoweth not neither for himſelfe nor for others, thoſe whome God loueth or hateth, or of what force his loue and hatred is. VVe muſt therefore vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the faithfull &amp; beleeuers: who though they cannot iudge of other men, ſpecially by their outward eſtate, of which it ſeemeth Salomon ſpeaketh here, whether God loue any man, or hate him, yet concerning himſelfe, or for Gods loue or hatred towards him, he cannot either be ignorant or doubtfull of it, becauſe he knoweth and feeleth the loue of god tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards him, as an adopted child, and that by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofes and pledges, then outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as we may perceiue not onely by the 7. verſe of this chapter, where he ſaieth, <hi>go eate thy bread with ioy &amp;c. for god novv accepteth thy works.</hi> but alſo by this of Iohn, in his firſt epiſtle fourth chapter. <hi>Heerin was the loue of God made manifeſt amongſt vs, becauſe God ſent that his onely begotten ſonne into this vvorld that we might liue through him,</hi> and ſundry ſuch other places. And therefore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2304:23"/> this is a non ſequitur, as we ſay in the ſchooles or an euill fauoured argument. By outward things men cannot determine of Gods loue or hatred, and therefore we cannot conclude of it out of Gods word. What and if a man ſhould reaſon thus? In the ſame bookes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon ſaith, we cannot by outward euents ſee a ſenſible difference betwixt mans ſoule and beaſts life, becauſe the end of either is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, therfore we can by no other meanes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the difference; it were falſe, and indeed would not hould or followe. By all theſe things then we may perceiue that howeſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we vnderſtand this place, of the loue or hatred of God towards men, that yet it will make nothing for the Papiſts, to eſtabliſh their doctrine of doubting, touching the grace of God and the free pardon and ful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of our ſinnes. That we may take no aduantage of this, that Papiſts affirming, that ſuch as offend againſt their conſciences, doe wel inough knowe, that they are vnder gods hatred, and God is angrie with them doe by this doctrine croſſe their owne ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. And againe it that be true in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2304:24"/> parties, why ſhould they enioyne ſuch as are turned to God, and doe vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent them of their ſinnes, to doubt of the grace and loue of God towards them. But let vs returne, and deliuer the true and naturall meaning, and ſee whether that will helpe any whit at all. I knowe that both Iewes and Chriſtian expoſitors alſo doe giue diuers ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this one place, but to me, this following ſeemeth moſt right. In this chapter as I take it, he dealeth with ſuch a ſort or kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration or ordering of thinges in this world, as is beyond mans reach: &amp; he ſetteth it out by ſundry particulars, the firſt whereof is conteined in this firſt verſe, and ſome of the verſes following, and indeede reſpecteth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s perſons, and the ſeuerall euents and ſucceſſes that followe them. And yet in this firſt verſe he doth not onely declare, the iudgement of fleſh &amp; blood concerning the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues but alſo expreſſeth what he himſelfe conceiued of it according to truth and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. This is it then that he meaneth, that hauing ſet his heart not onely to ſearch into theſe things, ſo farre forth as he could by any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2304:24"/> grace in himſelfe from god but alſo to ſpeake of them as time and occaſion ſerued, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by experience that he was ſo farre of to ſhutt God out, from ordering and diſpoſing of all theſe men and their matters, that he tooke it rather for fury and madneſſe in men to think otherwiſe, ſpecially ſeeing both men &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters plainely ſay that there is nothing be it neuer ſo ſmale, but that all and euery one of them are gouerned according to the becke and good pleaſure of almighty God. And as for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe he was ſo far of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> guiding &amp; gouerning theſe things that either he knewe not his owne eſtate in the things themſelues: or els if he had them, whether they were things worthy either to be beloued, or to be hated, he could not tell howe to vſe them. Nowe what will this auaile to prooue doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for our good eſtate and forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes before God, whereas it ſpeaketh that the vnregenerate, whoſe beaſtly blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and blockiſhnes is ſo great, that neither can they diſcerne of Gods adminiſtration &amp; gouernment of their owne eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor of the things that God in mercy or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2304:25"/> iudgement hath beene pleaſed to lay vpon them? Surely they are ſo wide, and indeede vnnaturall &amp; vnreaſonable, that from meere naturall men, will iudge, of thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and ſanctified from God. But we will leaue this, and proceed to the ſifting, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, and anſwering of ſuch places as they produce and alleadge out of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſpecially ſuch as they make moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of and preſſe moſt, as they that muſt beare the ſtreſſe of this cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Places out of the newe Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt place which they obiect out of the newe Teſtament, is Rom. 3. verſe 28. which they turne thus, <hi>We thinke that a man is iuſtified by faith without workes:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they inferre and inforce that ſith the Apoſtle vſeth the worde of thinking, that therefore no man can certenly affirme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his owne iuſtification. But we haue many exceptions againſt this interpretations as firſt that though it be ſo in the old latine tranſlation, yet the word that the Apoſtle v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the originall, is of a more ſure and certen ſignification. For the vvord ſignifieth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2304:25"/> to reaſon or to gather togeather, or out of the premiſes to put downe, a collected or ſure aſſertion, and the ſame to deliuer alſo in wordes or ſpeech. And this almoſt all the greeke interpreters, the beſt expoſitors of their owne words, haue obſerued and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Theophilactus who turneth the ſimple verbe that the Apoſtle vſeth, by a compound which ſignifieth by reaſoning to euince to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and out of ſuch thinges, as were not onely probablie but trulie put downe, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarilie to effect and conclude. But ſuppoſe we had not this in iuſt and ſufficient anſwer: yet we know and beleeue, that there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betweene doubting and thinking: the one alwaies containing in it and vnder it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, and the other manie times hauing certaintie adioyned with it. For though we will not denie but that ſometimes in the latin tongue, the word to thinke is doubtingly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet we ſhall finde in good and approued authors, that very often it ſignifieth after the propounding of diuers opinions, and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to chooſe out that which a man will aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irme and mainteine. And ſo we doubt of it in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2304:26"/> this place, it implieth not a doubtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certen imagination, for in a matter of ſo great importance, the Apoſtle would not deale ſo ſleightely with the Chuch and the members of it, but an aſſured and ſteadfaſt affirmation, which as yet may appeare by the nature of the greeke word aboue mentioned: ſo me thinketh it is confirmed by the weight of the cauſe or matter the the Apoſtle hath in hand, which is free iuſtification through faith in Chriſt: of which howſoeuer ſometimes ſome good men in the weakneſſe of their faith, and beholding of their owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe may or doe doubt, yet the doctrine of it, was, is, and euer ſhall be moſt ſure and ſtable. And therefore vnleſſe they would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually confound the tearmes of doubting and thinking, this text or teſtimony will doe them no good. And if it ſhould be of ſuch a doubtfull ſignification alwaies, then muſt it ſo likewiſe in all places, for that which is ſo at all times is the ſame euery where, and cannot be varied, as in reſpect of difference or diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of place. But that cannot be ſo, for we ſhall ſee this word in other places, &amp; namely in ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2304:26"/> places of this epiſtle, cannot admit or receiue this doubtful ſenſe, and therefore not heare neither: we will but take one in ſtead of all, namely, Rom. 8. verſe 18. For <hi>I thinke that the afflictions of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glorie which ſhal be ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</hi> What ſhall we thinke that the Apoſtle doubted of this point: whether that our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings here and the glory to be reuealed in the life to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e were vnequal, ſurely he knewe and felt well enough the great oddes and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is betwixt them, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him in another place to ſay, <hi>our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which is hut for a while, cauſeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs a far more excellent and eternall weight of glory.</hi> And I ſuppoſe verily the groſſeſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt in the world, and greateſt merite-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger amongſt them, would not defend this, that there is a partie, betweene the ſufferings of all or any of the Saints and the infinite and incomprehenſible ioyes of eternall life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what Logitian is there that ſeeth not that there is in this argument, falacia <hi>homo ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias,</hi> that is as we may ſay of the equivocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or doubtfull and diuers ſignification of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2304:27"/> word to thinke, which though ſometimes &amp; in ſome places, it may ſignifie to doubt &amp; yet that hath bin ſhewed on this part, yet here for the reaſons aboue alleadged, it muſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie certenty and aſſurednes, though not of the feeling of this truth alwaies in the hearts and mindes of the godly, who ſomtimes feele it and ſometimes not, yet of truth and certenty of the doctrine it ſelfe, which can be no more vncerten, then God himſelfe from whome it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mteh, or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpirit it ſelfe, by which the Apoſtle preached &amp; deliuered the ſame. To conclude, this is the plaine meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: that from the former diſputation, or points that before had bin handled, he did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily gather, &amp; finely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or faithfull man, was iuſtified through faith in Chriſt, and not by the workes of the law. And good reaſon he ſhould conclude ſo out of the premiſſes: for he had before euin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced &amp; proued this, that all men whether they were Iewes or Gentiles, the Gentiles without the lawe, &amp; the Iewes by &amp; vnder the lawe were ſinners and tranſgreſſors of the lawe, &amp; therefore deſtitute &amp; void of righteouſnes in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2304:27"/> &amp; of themſelues: &amp; righteous they muſt be if they would be ſaued: but that they could not be without Chriſts righteouſnes, &amp; the ſame apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by faith only. And therefore be might ſafely infer &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that he did.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond place which they bring out of the new Teſtament, is out of the 9. chap. of the Epiſtle to the Romans ver. 20. where it is ſaid. <hi>Be not high minded but feare.</hi> therfore ſay they, we are to doubt of Gods grace and fauour towards vs. But we anſwere. Firſt that this is ſuch a falacie of homo nymie or equivocation of words as the former. For feare doth neither alwaies, nor yet for any thing that they haue ſaid for the moſt part implie doubting. What difference there is betwixt theſe two tearmes hath in part bene ſhewed already, neither neede we to inſiſt therevpon nowe. The badneſſe of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may appeare by this. We muſt feare alwaies: therefore we muſt doubt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. If any ſhould ſay ſo, it were a badde concluſion, vnleſſe a man would or could prooue feare and doubting to be tearmes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uertible. Feare we know is vrged &amp; preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2304:28"/> vpon vs in the word, not ſo much to work doubting in vs either concerning god or our ſelues ſupported by him, as to cauſe vs vnfainedly to reuerence his maieſtie &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and circumſpectly to walke as in regard of ourſelues, and by reaſon of our ſpirituall and bodily enemies alſo. And he that either knoweth the nature and ſignification of the words, or obſerueth his own heart or waies well ſhall find this to be the thing that God aimeth at, when he ſo much calleth vpon vs for feare, rather then to intangle the hearts of his people with doubtfulneſſe or diſtruſt. But concerning the place it ſelfe we are to know that the drift and purpoſe of the ſpirit by the Apoſtle is, to humble the Gentiles, whoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection from before all times and vocation in time, God hath bene pleaſed in thoſe daies &amp; the age of the world, to manifeſt vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and others, which fauour as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold practiſed to themſelues ſo with all the ſame a iudgement of caſting of from God exerciſed and executed agaiſt the Iewiſh na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, who not long before, of all the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the world, in the generalitie or body of it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2304:28"/> had beene the onely peculier people and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of God. Nowe knowing that the Gentiles, on the one ſide with their owne graces vouchſafed vnto them, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, with the iudgement of the Lord exerciſed vpon the Iewes, might eaſily be puffed vp aboue meaſure, he aſſaieth to keep them vnder, and to preuent the extremitie of preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or pride, which he doth by theſe words ſaying, <hi>Be not high minded, but feare.</hi> Vſing feare not for doubting for that had beene to haue drawne them from one vice to another, but for reuerent and humble ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of themſelues in the mideſt and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thoſe mercies that God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed them, for the better effecting whereof he vſeth in that place and inferreth alſo many arguments drawne both from the Iewes and Gentiles: as if the fall of the Iewes were the riches of the Gentiles, how much more ſhall their fulneſſe be it, and their aſſuming againe: and thoſe legall and metaphoricall ſpeeches of the holy firſt fruits attributed to the Iewes of wild oliue trees grafted in their ſtead ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Gentiles, and ſuch like doe plainely
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2304:29"/> ſhewe the ſame. So that here we may ſee we are not commaunded or exhorted, to doubt of Gods grace and fauour towards vs tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our election, ſaluation, forgiuenes of ſinnes, &amp;c. For they are all ſure and certaine in God euen as he is in his owne nature and in the trueth of his promiſes, as they are manifeſted vnto vs in his word, and ſealed vp in Chriſts death, though we ſometimes come ſhort by reaſon of our weakeneſſe feebleneſſe and wants in the apprehenſion and application of them to our ſelues: but this rather we are admoniſhed of, not proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be puffed or ſtirred vp, as in nature we are wont to be, neither yet to leane vnto our owne wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, &amp;c. which is nothing that we take and thinke it to be: neither yet to reioyce of it as before God, for all in his ſight is as a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſtained cloath, nor to be puffed vp in it, as in reſpect of other men, becauſe we haue nothing, but we haue receiued it, and hauing receiued it there is no reaſon why we ſhould bragge of it, and beſides that which we haue is farre ſhort both of that it ſhould
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2304:29"/> be and that many other haue receiued aboue vs. But rather that we ſhould confeſſe, as our owne weakeneſſe and vnworthineſſe on the one ſide, ſo Gods grace and goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs one the other ſide. And this may we perceiue by the words which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had vſed a little before ſaying, <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelfe againſt the braunches: and if thou boast thy ſelfe, thou beareſt not the roote, but the roote thee.</hi> And therefore this feare, that the Apoſtle commendeth and commandeth here is not the ſame that doubting is, but is oppoſed to contempt &amp; pride, &amp; in as much as if he ſhould ſay, modeſtly, ſoberly, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully feare and reuerence god, leaſt otherwiſe through careleſnes, contempt, pride or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, thou that art a Gentile prouoke him to manifeſt iudgement againſt them, as he hath done againſt the people and nation of the Iewes, his firſt beloued ones.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A third place obiected is, 1.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2304:30"/> &amp;c. But I beſeech them to tell vs from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they will fetch this concluſion: as whether from the particular wordes, or from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall drift of the place. If from the wordes which are they that will prooue this wodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concluſion: by theſe wordes, <hi>him that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he ſtandeth,</hi> he meaneth doubtleſſe ſuch a one as is wiſe in his owne eies, and hauing confidence in himſelfe, imagineth he is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and able to ſtand, when other men are weak, and ready to fall. So that he ſignifieth and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out here by proud and preſumptious perſons, who haue no familiarity or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with doubting or diſtruſt, nay are ſo farre remooued from that, that they are tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to another extreme, namely to hautie and proud imaginations concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their owne ſtrength. And where he ſaith, <hi>take heed ye fall,</hi> it would be marked that he ſaid not ſo much as feare, much leſſe let him doubt, but let him beware, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly looke vnto himſelfe. And good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is he ſhould do ſo. For none are more nigh danger, then thoſe that are wiſe in their own eies, and preſume vpon their own
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2304:30"/> ſtrength, becauſe when they thinke beſt of themſelues, they thinke leaſt of that which may betide them, and ſo be ſooneſt intrapped in ſinne through ſecurity and careleſneſſe of their owne eſtate, or the malice and power of their enemies that riſe vp againſt them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is not onely probable but certaine, that by falling he meameth not vtter falling from the grace of God, for that can they neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e into that are his, for <hi>thoſe whome the Lord loueth, he loueth vnto the ende,</hi> but ſlipping or ſliding into ſinnes and tranſgresſions, and thoſe neither not of the higheſt degree, but of the meaneſt nature, which he calleth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>temptations appertaining to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which though in their owne nature (as any other ſinne ſhould) may diſmay vs much, yet ſhould they not worke as in reſpect of God and his goodneſſe towards vs doubtfulneſſe in vs, becauſe <hi>thoſe whome he loueth he loueth,</hi> as we haue heard already <hi>vnto the ende,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the weakeneſſes and wants that be in them. And the drift of the place will as little availe them. For by that which goeth before, as alſo by that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2304:31"/> after, we may ſee, that the ſpirit laboureth nothing more then this to drawe the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians from ſecurity, to heed and carefulneſſe which he doth, as by propunding vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, auncient examples of Gods wrath, againſt a people, that had very great priuiledges, and tokens of Gods fauour, ſo by this alſo, that they hauing a more plaine declaration of Gods will then the other, ſhould thereby learne to be more wary, leaſt otherwiſe not the like, but greater iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſhould breake forth againſt them, by howe much Chriſt was more plainely manifeſted amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them. And yet leaſt one ſide, they might flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to much, &amp; ſo not ſo carefully withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Satans ſubtilities as they ought, (for men that imagine more of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues then there is cauſe why, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly careleſſe: or on the other ſide thinke that this dealing of the Apoſtle was ſomewhat rough &amp; hard, (into which fault, when men are friendly admoniſhed by them, that loue and care for them, they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fall) he doth ſo with one hand by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition labour to preuent ſecurity, that be doth with the other raiſe them vp to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2304:31"/> leaſt they might imagine or thinke that he made them altogeather like to thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people of Iſrael that periſhed in the wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derneſſe. Now what is there either in the one or in the other, that fauoureth of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding doubting? For carefulneſſe one the one ſide, and comfort one the other (both which are the thinges he propoundeth here) are ſuch as haue no familiaritie or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with diſtruſtfulneſſe or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. In a word the Apoſtle here dealeth againſt carnall confidence and ſecuritie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning vs that we rely not to much vpon the graces that God hath beſtowed vpon vs, or flatter our ſelues in careleſſe ſecuritie, or ſtay our ſelues vpon our preſent eſtate, or fooliſh conceite and opinion that we haue of our ſelues: but rather that ackowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our weakeneſſe faintneſſe and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and alſo Gods grace and goodneſſe towards vs, we ſhould labour to liue in the feare of God, and combating againſt our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and fleſh, we ſhould craue Gods aide and aſiſtance againſt ſinne and Satan If the Apoſtle here then had forbidden the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2304:32"/> Corinthians to truſt in the promiſes of God, it had beene ſomewhat, but he is ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, that here he blameth them, for being ſo much puffed vp in the vaine confidence of fleſh and blood, and provoketh them rather to modeſty and lowelineſſe. And what is this to diſtruſt or doubting which is that they muſt prooue or els nothing.</p>
            <p n="4">4 They alleadge a fourth place out of Phil. 2. verſe 12. <hi>Worke out your owne ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with feare and trembling,</hi> therefore ſay they men muſt doubt of ſaluation. &amp;c. But this hath no more pith or marrowe in it then the former. Why may we not as ſafely alleadge it for free will and power not onely to doe good but to merite alſo as for maintenance and vpholding of doubting ad diſtruſt. The commandement ſeemeth to be plaine for the one: but the wordes of <hi>feare and trembling</hi> are not ſo ſufficient for the other. As therfore the commandement implieth not abilitie in parties commaunded, to doe the thing or things enioyned, but rather ſheweth what God requireth: ſo the wordes of <hi>feare and trembling,</hi> doe rather tend to breed careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2304:32"/> and circumſpection, then doubtfulnes or diſtruſt. And indeed if we ſhould reſpect the words themſelues, ſpecially the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: wee ſhall ſee that the place rather yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth argument of confidencie and boldnes then of doubting and diſtruſt. For if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement will inferr power in our ſelues to do the thing commanded, and we knowe that that which is in our owne hands we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie truſt vnto, and make no ſcruple or doubt of it, it will follow therevpon, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>feare and trembling</hi> may ſeeme in their ſenſe to implie doubting, yet power to work ſaluation being in men the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, will quickly expell that conceit vnleſſe they mind to hold, that a man at one and the ſelfe ſame time, ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied about one and the ſelfe ſame obiect, and hauing but one trueth or waye to leade him thereto, may yet doubt of himſelfe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of himſelfe. But the truth is, that the ſelf ſame ſpirite, that for taking away the conceit of mans freewill and power, preſently addeth it is God that worketh in vs both the will &amp; the deed according to his good pleaſure, doth in manie places of other his writings, &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

Nowe what worde is there in this text, that will implie doubting. If it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it is <hi>feare and trembling:</hi> but they (as wee haue heard already) import no ſuch matter, but rather ſignifie reuerence of God, and a certaine kind of childlike awe, and loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to offend, or diſpleaſe ſo gratious a father as our heauenly father is. Me thinketh wee may well expound this place by a ſentence of the Prophet Pſal. 2. Where he ſaith, <hi>ſerue the Lord in feare, and reioyce before him in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> what doeth he meane thereby, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? no ſurely, for the Apoſtle Iames telleth vs, that <hi>he that wauereth or doubteth recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing at all,</hi> but as he is inconſtant in all his waies, ſo he is ſent away emptie harted and handed from God: but he vnderſtandeth childlike feare, which is alwayes adioyned with faith, and is oppoſed not to doubting, as we haue noted already, but to carnall ſecuritie and careleſnes, which vaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2304:33"/> of our ſelues worketh in vs. Theſe men belike ſuppoſe that faith and feare cannot ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but they are deceiued: for the faithfull may both feare and beleeue alſo, yea and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy comfort and conſolation to, according as they reſpect either themſelues or God, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in God a ſupreame Maieſtie, which may cauſe them to feare or tremble, or behold in him largenes in promiſe, &amp; faithfulnes in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, and ſo not onely beleeue in him but reioyce alſo. In a word the Apoſtle mindeth not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to doubt of gods grace &amp; their owne ſaluation: for that had bin directly contrary to the truth, that he had in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deliuered, and all comming from one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and the ſame alwaies conſtant &amp; like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelfe, it could not be ſo repugnant: but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he commandeth feare to offend and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care and endeuour to auoid ſinne, ſpecially againſt our conſciences, and a deſire to liue vnto god, that is to ſaye, godlilie, righteouſlie and ſoberly in this preſent euill world, we not doubting and diſtruſting God and his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but beeing iealous ouer our ſelues, &amp; that not amiſſe, &amp; ſuſpecting our owne ſtrengths,

            <p n="5">5 Some other places they ſeeme to make

So that we may ſee, he is ſo farre off from miniſtring matter of doubtfulneſſe and diſtruſt, that he rather yeeldeth ſtrong conſolation, and by meanes thereof a peaceable and mightie perſwaſion, of Gods grace and aſſured goodneſſe toward vs in Chriſt, dealing no otherwiſe here, then as Paul hath done in ſundrie places before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, namely oppoſing feare to fleſhly ſecurity (which as we haue heard to much truſt and confidence in our ſelues bringeth forth) and not oppoſing it to doubtfulneſſe &amp; diſtruſt, which is ſet againſt the grace of god, and the aſſured truſt and hope that we haue concerning our ſaluation. Which as we may perceiue by that that goeth before, ſome
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2304:36"/> thinketh it will be euicted to that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth after, for preſently he addeth, knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that yee were not redeemed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things as ſiluer and gold, from your vaine conuerſations by the traditions of the fathers. Where we ſay, that with the feare he wiſhed them to haue, he coupleth this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t knowledge of our redemption in Chriſt: that as in the miniſtrie &amp; matter it ſelfe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is all aſſured certentie, ſo in our ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof all doubtfulneſſe and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe might be auoided, becauſe they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer fall out, but in things which are not ſurely knowne, ſteadfaſtly beleeued, or well and effectually felt.</p>
            <p n="6">6 To this they adioyne another place, out of the firſt chapter of his ſecond epiſtle, verſe 10. where he ſaith. <hi>Wherefore brethren giue rather dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But wee ſay this is ill inferred, and as we ſhall heare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none no ſuch thing to be gathered from it, but the contrarie rather. All doctrines muſt be gathered either from the generall ſcope of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2304:36"/> the place, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the particular words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that matter is deliuered. Let them take which they wil and gather it if they can. The purpoſe of the Apoſtle, in the verſes which goe before this is, alleadged, to prouoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtedfaſt faith and the ſound fruits thereof, for the better ſtirring of them wherevnto he vſeth two ſpeciall reaſons, the one from the fruite and profite, that they themſelues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould reape thereby, and this is verſe 8. the other from the miſerable eſtate of them that are voide of this precious faith, and the ſincere fruites and effects thereof, and this is verſe 9. vpon which in this tenth verſe, he inferreth a concluſion, as though he ſhould ſay, <hi>ſith through faith and tha fruites thereof, not onely much euill is auoided, but grace and goodnes communicated, and by thoſe fruites our calling and election, is approoued to others, and ſealed vp in our ſelues,</hi> and ſith this is the onely waie into Chriſts eternall kingdome of which he ſpeaketh verſe 11. ſurely it will well beſeeme and become vs to be wholie carried this way, vnleſſe we willbe counted, either fearefull contemners of grace and goodnes,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2304:37"/> or elſe deſperate caſters away of our ſelues. Now what is there here that may ſerue to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of doubting? or rather may not be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the other waie to vphold aſſurance of heart and of hope. And the like may we ſay for the words: which of them is it that will yeeld them any ſtrength? The word <hi>brethren</hi> is a word of loue, and no doubt miniſtreth much comfort and aſſurance to a godly mind (and therfore no doubt) when they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo reputed and taken of them that are indeed godly, and in ſome meaſure very well able to diſcerne, in both which reſpects Peter no doubt of it was a rare man, and therefore that terme could not but conſolate. If they will preſſe the terme, <hi>diligence:</hi> who ſeeth not the marueilous difference, betweene this, and that that they would haue ſhould bee meant thereby? who euer heard <hi>diligence</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for diſtruſt or doubting? it implieth labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious care and induſtrie in &amp; about the thing we would obtaine, which commonly alſo becauſe it is of commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, addeth an edge vnto mens ſtriuings: whereas diſtruſtfulnes or doubt, maketh them either vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2304:37"/> &amp; leaue of, or elſe to ſtriue with ſuch fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as there ar many times eaſily ouercome. For <hi>calling, election,</hi> &amp; <hi>making ſure,</hi> they are quite and cleane contrarie: as all which indeed are from God, and therefore are of the ſame nature that he is vnchangeable, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Apoſtle Paule in another place to ſay, <hi>the gifts and calling of God are ſuch as he can not or will not repent him ſelf of.</hi> Rom. 11. The worde of making ſure is not as in reſpect of God, for all thinges that he hath determined from before all times are certaine and ſure, &amp; ſhallbe accompliſhed in time, but as in reſpect of other men and of our ſelues, who may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie be drawne (but whether well yea or no that is the queſtion) to ſuſpect our ſelues, and to pronounce hard ſentence againſt others in the ſinnes we commit: the Apoſtle ſhewing that this is one good meane, either quite and cleane to remooue that temptation, or ſo to mitigate it, as it ſhall neuer maſter vs, ſtudiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, carefully and diligently to follow ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and holines, without which no man ſhall ſee God. VVherefore rather certainly then doubting, may be crawne and gathered
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2304:38"/> out of this place. For if faithfull people ſhould diligently and carefully labour, to make their vocation and election ſure and certen, which they are inioyned here, they may then make it ſure and certaine yea no doubt they do in ſome meaſure make it ſure and certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they doe indeed when they proceed in piety, and grow vp in godlines, &amp; the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſteadfaſt faith, and vnfained obedience to Gods holy will. For looke how much the more throughly they enter into the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of Chriſt, or as the ſcripture ſaith <hi>are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Chriſt,</hi> with ſo much the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſtudy, deſire, &amp; diligence, they growe in grace, &amp; proſper in the points of gods religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; chriſtian life. Now where we ſay they make it ſure, we muſt vnderſtand ſtill, as we haue already touched it, in reſpect of God whoſe purpoſe according to ellection is ſure and ſo remaineth, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 9.11. But as in reſpect of our ſelues and our neighbours. For by the workes that God commandeth in his lawe (of which no doubt of it the Apoſtle Peter treateth in this place) we may as vpon outward teſtimonies,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2304:38"/> fruites, and effects certenly conclude concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith: and by faith determine touching the ſpirit of God that dwelleth in vs, and ſo by conſequent alſo, concerning our calling &amp; election. For which purpoſe ſee, Romans 5.9.14. 1. Iohn 3, 24. and contrariwiſe alſo as appeareth Mat. 7.16.17. &amp;c. Indeed I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that this proofe and confirmation of them is not the firſt or principall, for that is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt, bearing record vnto our ſpirits, that we are the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of God, but yet it is a ſecondarie one as I may ſay, by which we may not onely probably, but charitably gather of others that beleeue, and certenly conclude and determine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelues, in as much as our own hearts and the ſinceritie thereof, and our own fruits and the ſoundenes of the ſame, are or ſhould be better known vnto vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all the world beſide. We ſee then, that that which in the handes of our aduerſaries, hath not ſo much as the ſemblance of a ſword to ſcarre vs, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned vpon them is of ſteele and verie pearcing, to runne through the ſides of that corrupted cauſe which they vphold: but ſuch
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2304:39"/> iudgements muſt they fall into, that labour to obſcure Gods glorie, and to diſmaye and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the minds of Gods people, that they in the ſoule ſhould be in the ſame ſtate either that the Midianites were of whome we read in the booke of Iudges, that the Lord <hi>ſet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans ſword vpon his neighbour and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all the hoſt,</hi> or elſe as Saul did, namely take a ſword, and fall vpon it, and kill themſelues.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The laſt place is out of the firſt epiſtle of S. Iohn chap. 3. verſe 21. <hi>If our heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs not, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue we boldeneſſe towards God.</hi> Out of which they reaſon by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thus: then muſt it needes followe, that if our hearts doe condeme vs, we haue not bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards God: and if not boldneſſe then doubting and diſtruſt. But we anſwere that the inferrence vpon the contrary is not right: for as boldneſſe and not boldneſſe are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: ſo we cannot alwaies ſafely inferre, vpon not hauing boldneſſe, diſtruſt, or doubting, becauſe there are many things beſides, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of the partie with whome we haue to deale, feare and ſhamefaſtneſſe in our ſelues and loathſomneſſe that ſtanders by, many
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2304:39"/> times ſhould be acquainted with our ſtates or ſuites, and ſundry ſuch like which may for a time daſh vs in our ſelues, &amp; yet not take a way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs for euer al hope to ſpeed, which in deede is doubting or diſtruſt But to the place it ſelfe: The purpoſe of the Apoſtle is as I take it, that the grace of adoption and neweneſſe of life which God vouchſafeth vnto vs, muſt be teſtified by good workes and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſound charitie and loue towardes our brethren, which as he commendeth for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects ſo ſpecially for ſundry good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it hath: as firſt, that thereby we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we are indeede God children, and his is in the firſt part of verſe 19. Secondly, thereby we may haue a peaceable and quiet conſcience, and this is in the laſt part of verſe 19. And this boldneſſe and quietneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which is the ſecond effect of ſound loue he commendeth by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary namely trembling of heart, with which they muſt needes be diſquieted, that are ſubiect to it: for how can it be that he that knoweth he hath God for his iudge, and not for his father (as the faithfull people onely haue him ſo) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:2304:40"/> be quiet in minde, beeing in his owne heart guiltie of horrible ſinne, as againſt God himſelfe in heauen, ſo againſt men vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth. And therefore we may ſafely ſay, that a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon is either not at all quiet; or els the grace that he would ſeme to haue, is nothing els but ſecuritie or ſenſeleſnes: and this feare is amplified by compariſon of the greater, namely God and his iudgement: into which amplification he entreth, not ſo much for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to whome he wrote, though it may be true they had ſome need and vſe of it, as for others that would not eaſily be brought to feeling: that ſo ſtong either with the teſtimony of their owne heart, or with the greatneſſe of Gods wrath and iudgement againſt them for ſinne, or with this terrible and heauy threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or with ſome one thing or other, they might ſtoupe &amp; learne to be humbled. Now what is this to doubting ſpecialy in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whome Iohn laboureth to raiſe vp to an aſſured hope, by their faith towards God, and love to the Saints or brethren: or if you will to the wicked, what is it to them who for the moſt part, are ſo farre from doubting,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2304:40"/> that they almoſt feare no euill: either here or els where, but as if it were being in a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>targie or dead ſleepe or ſenſlesnes, paſſe three daies without feare, yea without conſcience? But if this either doe not pleaſe or ſatisfie, we may ſay further: that he ſpeaketh here of a ſet purpoſe that men haue to doe euill, or to ſinne as we ſay againſt conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: he meaning that ſuch manner of perſons ſo long as they continue in that perſwaſion and practiſe alſo that they can hardly or not at all determine touching the certenty of our ſaluation, by the teſtimony of their owne hearts, becauſe they haue a ſting within them that witneſſeth the contrary. For this we muſt knowe that <hi>faith and a good conſcience are vnſeperable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi> and goe as it were arme in arme to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, as the Apoſtle ſheweth. 1. Tim. 1.19. Yea and that the fruites accompanying them are neuer vtterly ſundred from them, but at ſome one time or another are to be found in their meaſure, where the thinges themſelues are: and that therefore they that haue a good conſcience haue boldneſſe towards God and are well certified of his grace and their owne
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2304:41"/> ſaluation thereby. And that this in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning indeed it may appeare by ſundry words before going, as when he ſaith, <hi>By this that is true and ſincere loue to our brethren, we knowe that we are of the truth,</hi> that is belong vnto God, whome he ſignifieth alſo in the words following, when be ſaith, <hi>and ſhall before him aſſure our hearts, which aſſurance bringing with it peace, and tranquillitie, cannot but ſhut out and kill as it were all doubting.</hi> And againe in the words following when he ſaith <hi>hereby we knowe that he abideth in vs, euen by the ſpirit which he hath giuen vs.</hi> And therefore we may ſee that this place weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our aduerſaries doctrine, rather then that it doth any manner of way confirme &amp; ſtrengthen it. But if they will further vrge it as ſome of them doe, and ſay there is no man, but he is accuſed in his heart, and conſcience and therefore no man can haue confidence or boldneſſe before God. We tell them, firſt that the argument followeth not, for though the antecedent be trve, that euery good man eſpecially is ſtung more or leſſe yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent is not good, becauſe thouhh it be tru
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2304:41"/> that as in regard of himſelfe and of his ſinne and vnworthines thereby, he can haue litle or no aſſurance, yet as in reſpect of God, his word, his ſpirite Chriſts abſolute obedience, &amp;c. he may haue hope and boldnes. Secondly we ſay that it is no good or ſound reaſoning to reaſon from the facts of men, to or for the doctrine of God. For mans facts for the moſt part are euill and vnlawfull, whereas all the doctrines of God, are true and holie euen as he himſelfe: &amp; though men either in practiſe or perſwaſion would condemne him or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſhall he be iuſt when he ſpeaketh and pute when he iudgeth. Facts expreſſe or ſhewe things done: but neuer declare much leſſe proue the lawefulnes of the things practiſed. Beſides, though wee denie not, but that euen the faithful, are not onely conuinced but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in their heart and perſwaſion when they conſider their vnworthineſſe, yet feare we not alſo to affirme, that euen then they are abſolued and cleared alſo: for ſo often as they looke vnto themſelues and ſinne, they muſt of necesſitie be pricked and terrified, becauſe ſinne ſeene and felt indeed, can bring forth as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2304:42"/> in reſpect of it ſelfe, no better fruite. But on the other ſide when they behold Chriſt crucified and runne vnto the ſacrifice of his death, not onely of abſolute but of infinite merite, they finde in themſelues an aſſured peace, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alſo declareth. Romaines 5. where he ſaith. <hi>Then beeing iuſtified by faith, vve haue peace towards God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and in another place he affirmeth, that <hi>through Chriſt we haue boldnes and entrance with confidence by faith in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let this ſuffice for aunſwer to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and texts of Scripture, which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries for the eſtabliſhing of doubting and diſtruſt in the minds of the godlie doe vſually bring out of the old &amp; new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. With which we haue dealt firſt &amp; anſwered them, becauſe they make them the principall bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks and buttereſſes of this tottering wall. And indeed had they beene truely alleadged, ſuch as wee might haue reſted and relied our ſelues vpon: but beeing produced as they are, we ſee there is nothing in them but vanity, &amp; they that will accept them beeing ſo offred, are like to be bound vp in the winges of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2304:42"/> winde, &amp; carried away through the fcircenes of the iudgement of God againſt them, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall deſtruction. Now we come to their arguments drawne from humane authoritie; which are of two ſortes that is to ſaye, either reaſons and arguments, or authoritie &amp; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of eccleſiaſticall writers: The reaſons are manie as mans heart is cunning to deuiſe, and his braine buſilie beating vpon vanitie, &amp; lies, euen to vphold the ſame what he can. For our owne parts we will deale no otherwiſe here; then as wee haue done in the texts they haue alleadged, namely amongſt manie take thoſe that are moſt materiall, and confute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which beeing once fully and ſufficiently aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, all the reſt beeing weaker then wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will fall to the ground, and euen be ſpilt as it were of their owne accord.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Their firſt argument is couched or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thus. He that cannot know all his ſinnes, he cannot know whether he pleaſe God: and of this propoſition they render this reaſon, for it may ſo fall out, that he hath ſome hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or vnknowne ſinne, through which he hath diſpleaſed God. But no man knoweth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2304:43"/> or vnderſtandeth all his ſinnes, &amp; this aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they prooue by a place of the Prophet. Pſal. 19. where he ſaieth, <hi>who can vnderſtand hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> faults?</hi> therefore no man can tell whether he be in the grace and fauour of god, &amp; pleaſe him yea or no. To this we aunſwer, that the propoſition or maior as we call it, ſhould be true, if either god did for Chriſts ſake forgiue the beleeuers their knowne tranſgresſions onely, and not their vnknowne and hidden ſinnes alſo: or elſe if the worke of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, did depend either vppon our dignitie or worthines, or the ſuffiencie of our contrition and ſorrowefulnes for ſinne. But God we know, &amp; the Scripture in plaine tearmes teacheth vs, that God forgiueth in Chriſt to his children, al their ſinnes knowne and vnknowne, in which reſpect euen in the place by them alleadged, the Prophet preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith, <hi>Clenſe me from my ſecret faults:</hi> of which if there had not beene remisſion, he would not haue praied for it, for praier made according to faith for a thing, implieth that the ſame thing is to be obteined, or els were chriſtian praier not onely lipp labour, but loſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2304:43"/> labour: &amp; Saint Iohn ſaith, <hi>the bloud of Chriſt clenſeth vs from all ſinne,</hi> and againe, that <hi>he is the reconciliation not for our ſinnes onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world.</hi> And as for our reconciliation to God, it hangeth not vpon any worthineſſe that we haue as of our ſelues, or vpon the ſuffiency of any thing we do or can do, for we confeſſe as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haue done before vs, that all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes before God are as filthy and ſtained clouts, &amp; ſaie vnfeinedly as our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath taught vs, <hi>when we haue done al that we can doe, we are vnprofitable ſeruants.</hi> So that we may ſay and ſay ſafely, the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or maior is falſe, and that not onely for that which hath beene alleadged already: but alſo becauſe that the Scripture in many places, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of the children of God, in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their ſinnes, knowne or not known, felt or not felt in themſelues, confeſſed or not confeſſed before God, hath put downe many worthy and general comforts, as Iſaiah the 1. <hi>Though your ſinnes were as crimoſin, they ſhall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be white as ſnovv, though they vvere redd as ſcarlet, they ſhallbe as wooll:</hi> and in the newe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2304:44"/> Teſtament, Paule ſaith, <hi>where ſinne aboundeth there grace abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth much more.</hi> And though they add a reaſon or confirmation of it, yet that helpeth it not neither. For we knowe that all ſinnes in their owne nature doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God, and not onely hidden ſinnes. And if God vouchſafe mercie in the forgiuenes of all ſinnes and hidden ſinnes in all our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be ſinnes, why ſhould the conſcience more doubt of the forgiueneſſe of thoſe that it knoweth not or cannot remember, then it doth of thoſe that are euer before vs, ſith this is vſuall in all men, to haue their moſt high and heinous tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgresſion, in the ſting of their harts preſented before them, which being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of that they are remitted before God, the leſſe and the ſecret much more. As for the minor or aſſumption we will graunt it them: and yet they neuer a whitt nearer their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe remisſion of ſinnes, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort following therevpon, againſt the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of our hearts, ſtandeth not in knowing or feeling all and euery particular or ſpeciall ſinne that men haue committed, but in the liuely apprehenſion of the free fauour of god
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2304:44"/> declared in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly promiſes of his word not imputing vnto vs our tranſgresſion, nay which is more, imputing vnto vs through faith, that take hold thereof, the innocency, holines, &amp; obedience of Chriſt, with which being clothed as with a garment, we ſtand free from the force of his wrath, againſt all ſinnes knowne or not knowne, and haue hope aſſured for reconciliation and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as for the proofe of this aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the place of Pſal. 19. it was more then needes: and brought to confirme that which neuer was controuerted (for who euer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this into queſtion, that good men may &amp; doe commit infinite more ſinnes, then they doe or can remember.) But this rather whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this effect of doubting will follow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, in which they are more mute then fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp; ſpeaking where or what they ſhould not might well haue ſpared this labour.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecond argument they frame thus. He that only knoweth the heart, he only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the certety &amp; aſſurednes of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But God only knoweth the heart &amp; ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reines: therefore he onely knoweth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2304:45"/> the certenty and aſſuredneſſe of our ſaluation All the feare &amp; ſtrength of this reaſon reſteth in the maior or propoſition as we call it, &amp; in the large or narrow ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this word knower of the heart. Wherfore hauing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared or ſatisfied that, all the reſt will be found weaker then water, I meane for the ſtrength and maintenance of this matter. God is ſo the onely ſearcher and knower of the heart, that yet notwiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he hath in ſome meaſure euen communicated that grace vnto diuers of his children, though happely not as in reſpect of others ſo much, yet as in regard of euery particular faithful mans owne eſtate. For as this that God is onely wiſe, onely iuſt &amp;c. doth not euacuate or ouerthrowe the wiſdome, iuſtice, &amp;c. that from that infinite fountaine that is in him: is conveied ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men ſpecially his children, ſo that he alone knoweth mans heart, hindreth not this, but that other men may knowe, though not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, yet their owne hearts, reaſonable well: for this of ſearching the heart, is, as alſo the former aboue named, are of that ſort of attributes in or to God, which though they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2304:45"/> be in him in all abſolute fulneſſe, and without meaſure, yet are they communicated to the godly eſpecially, and that in ſuch meaſure as he ſeeth to be fit for them, and yet he hauing neuer a whit the leſſe in himſelfe. And this is, that in ſome ſort and ſenſe which Salomon ſaith in the Prouerbes. <hi>The thoughts of mans heart, are as deepe fountaines, but a man of vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtanding will drawe them drie.</hi> But more plainely and particularly the Apoſtle ſaith, No man knoweth the things of a man but the ſpirit of a man which is within himſelfe: but Gods ſpirit maketh the ſpirituall man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to iudge and diſcerne all things, yet he himſelfe to be iudged of no man. So that we may ſee that the maior propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here, but muſt of necesſitie be vnderſtood with a condition or exception thus. He that alone is the knower of the hearts, yea of all things, he onely is aſſured or certenly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our ſaluation, vnles it haue pleaſed him in his word, to reueale ſomthing concerning that vnto vs, and would haue vs thereby to be aſſured thereof. For then hauing commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated that knowledge which in himſelfe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2304:46"/> is abſolute and infinite, in ſome meaſure vnto vs, our knowledge comming from him and infuſed into vs, doth intitle vs in our meaſure therevnto, and yet notwiſtanding he in ſenſe before the onely knower of the heart. But as it is Gods good pleaſure in his word to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint vs with this matter, and by many meanes to labour not onely our knowledge therein, but alſo our aſſurance thereof, as we may perceiue by theſe notable ſentences. 2. Cor. 13. <hi>Prooue your ſelues whether ye are in that faith: examine your ſelues &amp;c.</hi> He dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling this exhortation or commandement rather, that ſo he might expreſſe the necesſity and excellency of this point. And the 1. Iohn 3. he ſaith, <hi>that by the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d loue in our hearts. we knowe that we are of the truth and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that is truth euen God himſelfe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our hearts.</hi> And therefore as in naturall things we doe from the effects gather of the cauſes, and that not onely probably but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly, for ſuch as the cauſe is ſuch are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: ſo in ſpirituall things we may yea we ought to doe the like, wherein though as in regard of others that are hypocrites we may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2304:46"/> be ſomtimes deceiued, yet as in reſpect of our ſelues, if we haue wiſe iudgement, and be able to put a difference betweene things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, we cannot lightly erre. For the minor or aſſumption of this ſyllogiſme, we confeſſe it alſo to be true, but yet in ſenſe before, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelfe ſame ſeruing to cleare and anſwere this propoſition, that hath beene deliuered for anſwere to the maior. But becauſe they ſuppoſe this argument to be weake, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioine vnto it another, as like it both for forme of reaſoning &amp; pith or ſtrength to proue as posſible may be, ſo that an egge is not ſo like to an egg, as we haue in the prouerb, then one of them is like another, ſaying, He that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not the heart, he cannot knowe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his ſaluation, for that were to ſearch the heart and the reines of men, which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth onely vnto God. But no man knoweth the heart, for that is proper vnto God onely, and therefore no man can knowe or be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red touching ſaluation. Wherevnto though that which hath bin deliuered to the former may ſuffice for full aunſwere, yet a word or two more to this, that ſo it may appeare they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2304:47"/> can ſay nothing, but that which is or may be eaſily aunſwered. The maior if they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of abſolute and exact knowledge is vtterly falſe, not onely becauſe men in this life cannot attaine to ſuch a knowledge, but alſo becauſe that the meaſure &amp; manner, that God hath in his word revealed vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is ſufficient inough to ſtrengthen their owne conſcience, and to make them by ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d effects and fruites charitably to iudge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though it doe not or cannot intitle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to that fulneſſe thereof that is onely in the Lord himſelfe. And as for the proofe adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this propoſition, it is of no force nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in reſpect of this cauſe, for God as we haue heard hath giuen in ſome meaſure that grace vnto men and ſpecially to his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and yet hath neuer a whit the leſſe thereof in himſelfe, or equalled them thereby vnto his maieſty. The minor likewiſe is falſe, for there are that knowe their owne hearts, and in ſome meaſure are inabled by the graces of the ſpirit, to ſound other mens, and that not onely extraordinarily, as Peter did the heart of Ananias and Sapphira his wife, Act. 5. but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2304:47"/> ordinarily as appeareth by the place of the proofe before alleadged, and yet not ruſh into Gods office, or be induced with abſolute and infinite knowledge as he, and therefore they are vtterly deceiued that obiect this. But for finall anſwere, in a word we ſay further. Though he that in ſome meaſure knoweth the heart, cannot abſolutely knowe it as God, becauſe that which is in him in all fulneſſe, is is him according to the meaſure that God which diſtributeth his graces ſeeth good: and therefore he cannot abſolutely knowe either himſelfe or others, to be of the number of them that ſhall be ſaued as God, or cannot be precedent or immediate matters iudge or de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termine thereof: for indeed that were to be God and not man. Yet by ſubſequent things or meanes men may knowe, as if it were by effects from cauſes, or by conſequents of or from antecedents, and not onely probably but truely and certenly gather concerning the matter. And me thinketh this argument may well be retorted and caſt backe againe thus againſt the aduerſaries themſelues. He that knoweth in ſome meaſure his owne and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2304:48"/> other mens heart, may from thence charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gather for others, and certainely conclude for himſelfe touching the fauour of God and eternall life: or elſe if this were not true, the light raiſed in vs, were darkeneſſe and of no vſe. But the faithfull doe in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as hath bin ſhewed before, receiue from God and feele in themſelues this grace: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may know and be aſſured of it, and by conſequent need not to doubt though not as in regard of themſelues (for ſo who will not be ouerwhelmed therewith) yet as in reſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pect of God, who is faithfull and faſt in all his promiſes and graces whatſoeuer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A third argument they inforce thus. He that knoweth not Gods wil, he cannot know Gods grace concerning himſelfe, and his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. But no man knoweth the will of God, according to that which is ſaid, <hi>who hath not knowne the minde of the Lord? or who was his councellour,</hi> which words are repeated. Iſaiah 48.13. &amp; Romanes. 11.34. Therefore no man can know or be aſſured of his ſaluation. But we will aunſwer firſt vnto the maior or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2304:48"/> by diſtinguiſhing: ſecondly vnto the minor or aſſumption, by explaning or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding rightly the places alleadged. God though he be but one, and therefore as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his own nature can haue but one will yet in reſpect of himſelfe, and men to whome he hath reuealed himſelfe by his word, who are by many meanes and waies diſtinguiſhed from himſelfe, he hath indeed &amp; is truely ſaid to haue a double wil, that is one ſecret in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; the other reuealed to men ſpecially to his people in his word. And leaſt wee ſhould ſeeme to ſpeake anie thing herein without warrant: let vs mark what God himſelfe ſaith in his law. Deuter. 29. <hi>The ſecret things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Lord our God: but the things reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led belong vnto vs and to our children for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that we may doe all the words of this lawe.</hi> In this behalfe or matter reſpecting gods wil, men are commonly ſick of two ſinnes, that is curioſitie to ſearch further then god hath bin pleaſed to manifeſt, and negligence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of that which is reuealed: in theſe words and by this diſtinction, God goeth about to repreſſe and redreſſe both, teaching men ſo
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2304:49"/> to abſtaine, from beeing wiſe aboue meaſure and ſearching into his wayes, councels and iudgements, that are beyond their reach, that yet they ſhould content themſelues with and ſtay vpon his manifeſted wil, labouring in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie and ſimplicitie of minde, to know and obey that onely which he hath reuealed vnto vs by his law. Now then if they vnderſtand their maior propoſition, of anie parte of the will of God, not reuealed vnto vs, they ſaye right, but ſith they ſpeake it and meane it of that that is diſcloſed vnto vs in his word, they ſpeake falſely. For as he that knoweth not the will of God, either manifeſted in the law and Goſpell, and that alſo concerning ſuch things as appertaine to our ſaluation: or his not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed will, that is his ſecret and vnknowne wil to vs, in ſuch matters as belong not to our ſaluation; as in the wonderfull gouernement of his Church, tranſlation of Empires &amp;c. can not be aſſured of eternall life, and this indeede is the ſtate of al the heathen of the world out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and of many other beſides. So one the other ſide, he that knoweth, beleeueth &amp; obeyeth, in ſome acceptable meaſure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2304:49"/> will of God (for by knowing God we do according to god &amp; his word vnderſtand, beleefe and obedience) can not chooſe but in thoſe fruites of his faith, know and be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that he is one put a parte to be a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full partaker of all Gods graces, concerning this life and that which is to come. And this is that Chriſt meaneth, when he ſaith Iohn. 17. <hi>This is life eternall: to know thee to be the only true God and him whome thou hast ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But the faithfull though they knowe not or be ignorant of, the hidden and ſecret will of God as it is meete indeed they be ſo, yet are very well acquainted with his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and manifeſted, whether it be in the lawe for obedience, or in the goſpell for faith, and therefore cannot be ignorant of the grace of God toward them and their ſaluation, but do certainely know it. For to that end was the law manifeſted at our firſt creation and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repeated againe, that we might know both that there is a God, and alſo what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of god he is, and that he will haue vs to be like vnto himſelfe, or elſe that wee ſhall finde him a ſharp and ſore puniſher of iniquitie and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2304:50"/> ſinne: and afterwards the Goſpell concerning the Mesſiah to come was publiſhed, that ſo we might both know and be aſſured of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes and reconciliation before God. And let this ſuffice for aunſwer to the maior. Now touching the minor propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or aſſumption, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the places before alleadged, if we aunſwere or truely expound the places, we ſhall then ſufficiently perceiue, how weake it is, for the confirmation of that wherevnto they are alleadged. For the place of Iſaiah, whether we conſider the generall drift of the Prophet in that chapter which is to comforte the Church, by propounding vnto them manie ſweet promiſes, ſpecially in the 11. firſt verſes of the chapter, or reſpect the particular words that they preſſe, yet ſhall we ſee that no ſuch thing as the diſcomfort of doubting or diſtruſt, can be inferred therev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, but rather ſtrong and ſound conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for ouer &amp; beſides the ſcope of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet already touched, the holy Ghoſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ſhew in ver. 12.13. in an excellent and loftie forme of words, that the promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made ſhall certainely be performed. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2304:50"/> this confirmation of gods promiſes is drawn from two ſpeciall places. Firſt from a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of all creatures, with the creator himſelf, whoſe nature ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth labour &amp;c. do approch nothing neare vnto God, and good reaſon it ſhould ſo be, not onely becauſe that that they haue, they haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; he is greater then all yea without them able to do what he will &amp; this, is conteined in the 12.13.14.15.16.17. verſes, and the other is from a declaration of Gods ſingular grace and workes, vouchſafed particularly <hi>to Abraham, and to his ſeede not onelie after the fleſh, but after the ſpirite,</hi> that is to ſay the Church, in the reſt of the verſes. Now in the particular verſes before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there are three arguments of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, the firſt is drawne from the Almightie power of God, which is manifeſted by his creating and ſuſtaining of all things: in the 12. verſe, the ſecond from his infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible wiſedome, in the 13. and 14. ver., and the third from his infinite maieſtie and might. in the 15.16.17. ver. Now what is ther here that may maintaine doubting? or rather may not miniſter comforte, ſpeciallie to his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2304:51"/> owne people, for whom it is prouided, and to whome it is pronounced, as may appeare by the firſt verſe of the chapter it ſelfe? Or howe doth it confirme that for which it is alleadged, that no man knoweth the will of God, concerning grace and eternall ſaluation: whereas we ſee it prooneth rather that God hath no need of man in any reſpect, either to waye and ſearch out his ſpirit, or els as a man of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, or as his counſellour to inſtruct and teach him. And we may almoſt ſay the ſame touching the place of Romanes 11. For the Apoſtle hauing before that 11. chapter. ſpoken of the reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iewes, &amp; the ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, affirming yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that when the fulnes of the Gentiles was come in, the Iewes ſhould for al their preſent caſting of in their poſteritiy or ſucceſſors be called, he ceaſed with that ſame wonderfull wiſdome of God in that heauenly worke or miniſtery which he would haue men rather religiouſly to reuerence, then curiouſly and profanely to ſearch after, ſpecialy beyond the bondes that God hath reuealed, crieth out in the verſe going before this, and in this and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2304:51"/> thoſe that followe, laboureth hy a threfold bridle as I may ſay, to repres the ſacrilegious boldnes of ſundry men. Firſt becauſe God is moſt wiſe, which he expreſſeth in this verſe, and that therefore it ſhould be moſt abſurd, yea vtterly and altogeather wicked, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him after our owne folly. Secondly that he is debter to no man and that he declareth verſe 35. but rather ſurmounteth their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes with his goodneſſe, and that therefore no man can iuſtly complaine of any iniury that he doth him. Thirdly that for his glory ſake all things were made, verſe 36. and that therefore we ſhould referre them all to his glory, and at no hand to thinke it ſafe or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs, to diſpute or reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter with him. Now what is here for doubting, which is the maine matter? or what ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prooue this, that no man knoweth, or can knowe Gods minde touching his grace and eternall ſaluation? becauſe God is moſt wiſe, yea onely wiſe, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. 1. Tim. 1, 17. ſhall no man therfore feele his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour or aſſure his owne heart, that the grace of forgiuenes of ſinnes, and the blesſing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2304:52"/> life belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnto him. Surely it is a lewſe and bad conſequent, and we ſhould be ſo farre from imbracing of it, that we ſhould ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as vnto a menſtruous and polluted thing depart hence and get away.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In the fourth place they reaſon thus. S. Paul ſaith 1. Corinth. 4. <hi>I knowe nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not thereby iuſtified, for he that iudgeth me is the Lord.</hi> Therefore Paul was not aſſured concerning his owne iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But herevnto we anſwere, firſt that this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, euen as the former alſo, would rather haue beene placed with the reaſons drawne from holy ſcripture, becauſe as we ſee they are taken therefrom, then placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the arguments that men make to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh that errour, but we will eaſily omit that ſcape, and not inſiſt vpon that point, as not much materiall. Secondly we ſay that the reaſon is but from example: which though here it may be good, and in ſome other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes, yet is not alwaies good: no not in good men, becauſe nowe we may ſay euen as the Apoſtle ſaith in an other place, &amp; another caſe alſo, <hi>vve knovve no more nowe after the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2304:52"/> fleſh, no not Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> And when they are at the beſt and higheſt they are rather argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of perſwaſion to lead men to do the like, then ſound &amp; ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reaſons to prooue the lawfulneſſe of the thing, for which they are alleadged. But we will let this alſo goe, &amp; followe that which is of more weight, and importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. As for this argument, if we know or vnderſtand rightly what the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by theſe wordes, it is or will be eaſily abſolued: for the knot is not ſo hard tvviſted or tied as they imagine. It ſeemeth vnto men that as verſe 1. of the 4. chap. he had put the people in minde of their duties towards their miniſters, namely that though they might not account them Lords and rulers, yet they ſhould eſteeme them as ſuch whome Chriſt had ſent, euen by their hands to deliuer vnto them, the treaſures &amp; hidden ſecrets of Gods kingdome and ſaluation. So in the next verſe he had told the miniſters &amp; preachers of the word what was their duety, namely that in the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their charge they ſhould cary themſelues, not as Lords but as ſeruants, yea as faithfull ſeruantes who muſt one day
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2304:53"/> re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der an accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the diſcharge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to God. And becauſe he had ſet forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as an example, &amp; yet many of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians regarded him not, but eſteemed him as a baſe perſon, he doth verſe 3. vſe a preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he litle or nothing at all ſtayeth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the contrarie iudgement that they had of him. And leaſt he might be thought to haue ſpoken this without reaſon, he ſheweth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reaſons, why he eſteemeth not their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and corrupted iudgements concerning himſelfe. The firſt is, that when men iudge in theſe matters according to their own braine and vnderſtanding, it ought to be accounted of no greater weight, then if ignorant men ſhould take vpon them to iudge of learning and wiſedome, or of wiſe and learned men: &amp; this is conteined in the latter part of verſe. 3. The ſecond is taken from his owne perſon, and theirs together, as if he ſhould ſay: How are yee able to iudge what manner of man I am in the execution of my miniſterie, ſith I my ſelfe, who by all probability ſhould in that behalfe better knowe my ſelfe then yee can, yea in a good conſcience can teſtifie before
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2304:53"/> God and men, that in that charge, I haue in ſome good meaſure vprightly behaued my ſelfe, dare not yet therfore arrogate any thing to my ſelfe? For I know that yet I am not for all that vnblameable ſpecially before God, or that I ſhould pleaſe and flatter my ſelfe as yee doe, and this is the argument that the Apoſtle vſeth in this 4. verſe. What is here againſt the certainetie of Paul iuſtification before God: or the aſſurednes of his heart as in that reſpect. He ſheweth they could not iudge him, becauſe he, himſelf was not able throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exactly to diſcerne himſelfe: muſt he therefore doubt of his righteouſneſſe and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation before God? Surely it will not follow, for firſt beſides that god and man differ, it is not ſafe to inferr vpon a godly mans debaſing of himſelfe for ſome reſpect before men, his doubting in the ſight of God, or his diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of his mercies towards him. Manie a man debaſeth himſelfe before God, and yet hath hope in his heart, yea the more for that, becauſe God reſiſteth the proud &amp; preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and giueth grace to the lowlie and meeke as the ſcripture ſaith. And though we
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2304:54"/> ſhould vnderſtand it of iuſtification before God yet other places of ſcripture and ſome thing in this (for the ſpirit is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to it ſelfe) ſhould declare it. For ſurely the Apoſtle here doubteth not, whether the newenes of life &amp; good works which he being renewed had done, were ſeales &amp; pledges vnto him of this, that he was iuſtified before God, but plainely &amp; ſimply denieth that by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was iuſtified, which as we may confirme by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of the Apoſtle Phil. 3. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith <hi>that he hath no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> &amp; that if any other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinketh he hath ought wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might truſt in the fleſh, much more he who touching the righteouſnes which was in the law was vnrebukeable, ſome thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſtandeth vpon religious reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all our righteouſneſſe, are as filthy and ſtained cloathes, and when we haue done all that we can doe we are vnprofitable ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſo many defects, yea corruptions cleaue vnto our beſt, and moſt religious duties as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea it ſhould ſeeme that he in this very place rendreth a reaſon of it, becauſe that though he were vnblameable before men,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2304:54"/> yet he could not by his workes ſtand before Gods iudgements, or God himſelfe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſuch perfect obedience, that if a man performe not all things commanded in his lawe, he ſubiecteth him to the curſe thereof, or as Saint Ieames ſaith chap. 2. <hi>He that offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in one, is guiltie of them al</hi> And ſo if you will needes vnderſtand it of this iuſtification the Apoſtle ſheweth, that he had need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſnes then his owne, namely the abſolute and perfect righteouſnes of Chriſt the mediatour, which he may ſafely oppoſe againſt gods wrath &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; be therby iuſtified and accepted euen vnto eternall life. And of this iuſtification, becauſe it is abſolute &amp; infinite, he neuer ſpeaketh doubtfully, but alwaies reſolutely, as Rom. 5. <hi>Being iuſtified by faith we haue peace towardes God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And againe Romanes 8 <hi>It is god that iuſtifieth, who ſhall condemne.</hi> So that we ſee &amp; may ſay, that take it which way they will or can, it can not or will not, in the truth of the ſpirit, ſpeake that they would haue it, or prooue that for which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:2304:55"/>5 A fifth argument they frame thus, we are vncerten ſay they concerning predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or election, that is as they themſelues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it or muſt expound it, we cannot out of Gods word ſhew, whome God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen vnto himſelfe, vnleſſe beſides and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word we haue ſome ſpeciall or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reuelation: therefore we are vncerten, and by conſequent doubt alſo concerning Gods grace of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. Herevnto we anſwere, that we deny the antecedent of this Enthymenie, or maimed ſyllogiſme: and we haue good reaſon ſo to doe, yea many good reaſons indeed. For firſt this is falſe, which they ſay, that we cannot by Gods word be aſſured of predeſtination or election. For God hath as plainely and ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that point, as posſibly may be, and that not onely by affirming it here &amp; there, in ſome ſhort ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, but by large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and as it were diſcourſes and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes made of purpoſe concerning it, as may appeare from the middle of the eight chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the epiſtle vnto the Romanes, to the ende of 11. chapter of the ſame epiſtle, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2304:55"/> Eph. 1. and ſundry other places. But if they will ſay they meane it of perſons elected, and not of the doctrine, and indeed ſo their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſeemeth to lead that way, yet then we tel them alſo that is falſe and faulty as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For by the word of God we are able not onely rightly to iudge of that which is paſt concerning the reiection of the Iewes, the election of the Gentiles, &amp;c. but alſo both probably togeather and charitably to iudge of others, as we ſee the Apoſtle Peter doth of the ſtraungers that dwelt here and there. 1. Pet. 1. verſe 2, Yea and of ſome naturall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo as Iohn doth in his ſecond Epiſtle to the elected Ladie: and certenly alſo to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine concerning our owne eſtates that way, whether we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider our ſelues by our ſelues ſingularly, or as we are ioyned with the reſt of Gods elect, we ſaying of our ſelues and of them in our meaſure touching the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes, as Saint Iohn ſaith for himſelfe and the faithfull in that behalfe. <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſinne, we haue an aduocate with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ieſus Chriſt the righteouſe, and he is the reconciliation for our ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2304:56"/> gods loue towards vs in Ieſus Chriſt for eternall life, as Saint Paule ſpeaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the ſound members of the Church, ſaying, <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent nor things to come nor heigth nor depth, nor anie other creature ſhallbe able to ſeparate vs, from the loue of god which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord,</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle be deſtroyed we haue a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding giuen of God, that is an houſe not made with hands but eternall in the heauens.</hi> And this wee iudge not ſo much by Gods eternall election it ſelfe, though we know, beleeue, &amp; perſwade our owne hearts, that ſuch a thing there is in God, becauſe that is alwaies hidd in himſelfe, euen as we may ſay in the boſome and breſt of his euerlaſting free knowledge, though by manie good meanes, as wee ſhall heare anone he diſcouereth the ſame vnto vs, but by certain and aſſured infallible notes that he hath giuen vs in his word, by which wee may know and be aſſured for our ſelues, and according to truth and charitie may iudge of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2304:56"/> others, and that without any ſpeciall reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as theſe men fantaſie, that we are of the number of gods elect, as if god giue vs an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling through the miniſterie of the word, and working of the ſpirit, and make vs comfortably to feele the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and a ſtedfaſt hope of eternall glorification, wee may aſſure our ſelues of our election, as we may perceiue by that the Apoſtle ſaith. Rom. 8. <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo he hath called, &amp; whome he hath called them alſo he hath iuſtified, and them whome he hath iuſtified, them he hath alſo glorified:</hi> and 2. Timoth. 1. <hi>God hath ſaued vs, and called vs with an holie calling, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our works, but according to his owne purpoſe and grace, vvhich vvas giuen to vs through Ieſes Chriſt before the world vvas</hi> as alſo if he giue vs care and conſcience of well-doing, it pleadgeth the ſame grace vnto vs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which Saint Peter ſaith, <hi>giue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> And therfore we ſee that gods election, euen as it is manifeſted vnto vs in gods word, is farr of from ouerthrowing, our certainety &amp;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2304:57"/> hope of ſaluation, that looking vpon it, and into it, as he would haue vs iudge of it, it doth indeed confirme and eſtabliſh the ſame, both as in reſpect of it ſelfe becauſe ſo it is alwaies ſure and certaine, and alſo as in regard of our fainting hearts and feeble hope, which by this meanes are vpheld, as the Churches. Canticl. 2. <hi>was ſtaied with flagons, and comforted with appells.</hi> As for that which they ſpeake of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſpeciall reuelation, it is againſt the truth of holy Scriptures and grounds of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, for God hauing in theſe latter daies ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs in the perſon of his ſonne and abſolutely and fully reuealed his will in his word, with this threatning that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer addeth therevnto, vpon him ſhalbe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth all the plagues written therein, he hath taught vs thereby, to caſt away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect as diueliſh and abhominable all ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, beſides that it ſtrongly ſauoureth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtrie, which for manie fond fantaſies of their owne haue nothing to ſay, but onely pretend odd reuelations or viſions. But yet our aduerſaries vrge this pointe further and ſay: that men muſt beware of raſh entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2304:57"/> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling or hearing, of that ſame reuerend &amp; hidd miſterie of gods predeſtination. And who will not ſay ſo, as well as they. But let vs ſee whether this be a good argument: Gods predeſtination muſt not be raſhlie ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, either for hearing or handling, therefore men muſt doubt of Gods fauour that way, &amp; euery other way beſides: it followeth not. No more then this. The ſacred authority of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and magiſtrates, muſt not be eſteemed or violated as a light thing: therefore ſubiects muſt doubt whether their princes fauour, or affect them, me thinketh it would rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. There is in god ſuch high and heauenly things, therefore we ſhould be better perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his might, goodwill, fauour &amp;c. as in princes their maieſtie, authoritie, &amp;c. ſhould aſſure their ſubiects of loue, care and all for their defence. But we will come to the point, wee take that to be raſh preſumption in the matter of this miſterie, when either we looke into this ſame hidden, &amp; ſecret cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of god, as it is in it ſelfe or in him alone, ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe teſtimonies and tokens that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs to diſcerne it by: or when we willbe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2304:58"/> more curious in it, then he hath bin pleaſed to manifeſt in his word. Nowe that this is to be auoided, and to be taken heed of, as a high ſin &amp; the infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſoules, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, becauſe it is to be wiſe aboue meaſure, &amp; in the things that God would not haue vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal. And we know that we muſt not iudge of this matter, <hi>à priori,</hi> as the ſchool me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, that is by things going before, for we knowe them not, but by things following, which may be diſcerned, becauſe they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and ſet downe vnto vs in the word: nor yet beſides or without the word, for then we ſhall wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der in darkenes more groſſe then that of Egypt, &amp; be ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with many odd and ſwimming conceits. But we muſt out of the word &amp; by conſequents according to the word determine of the matter, otherwiſe we ſhall not onely ſpeake at aduenture but faile, becauſe there &amp; not elſe where, God hath for this, and al other matters &amp; miſteries, plainely and plentifully reuealed his will. And though it be true that euen the writinges before the law was giuen and after it was deliuered doe deſcribe this matter vnto vs, yet wee muſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2304:58"/> principally fetch it from the goſpell, becauſe therein God doth eſpecially diſcouer, the decrees that he hath made with himſelf from before all times, concerning our ſaluation, in which Goſpell we ſhall ſee, more teſtimonies and tokens giuen vnto vs, for the aſſurance of our hearts in it, then as yet we haue heard of, as Chriſts death yea the death of the croſſe for the redemption of mankinde: the miſtery of the calling both of Iewes and Gentiles by the miniſterie of the word: ſaith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance giuen vnto men, through the hearing of the word preached: the iuſtifying and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them which through faith beleeue in Chriſt, and by meanes thereof take hold of him to eternall life: and laſtly the teſtimony &amp; pleadge of the ſpirit, bearing record vnto our ſpirits that we are Gods ſonnes, yea heires, yea fellow heires with our Sauiour Chriſt, in which reſpect it is alſo elſe where called the earneſt of our inheritance. Epheſians the firſt ver. 14. And this I thinke may ſuffice for this point.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Their ſixt argument or reaſon is thus framed. He that hath not in himſelfe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2304:59"/> obedience of gods law, cannot certainely conclude that he pleaſeth god, but muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesſitie ſtill doubt: becauſe we know that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can pleaſe god but perfect obedience: and againe this condition is added to the law, doe this and thou ſhalt liue: alſo keepe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements &amp;c. But no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath in him that perfect obedience: therefore no man can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely conclude that he pleaſeth God. To all which we anſwer that we haue many things iuſtly to except againſt it: As firſt that the maior or propoſition is not onely fraile but falſe, in the ſenſe that they ſet it downe in, yea though that it haue adioyned vnto it a double reaſon to ſtrengthen it withall. For a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue a good thing, yea that good thing they ſpeak of, namely perfect obedience in himſelf, though not of himſelfe and yet be ſure that by reaſon of that which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, he pleaſeth God. If they would haue dealt plainely and haue ſaid thus, he that hath neither in himſelfe, nor of himſelfe perfect obedience, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſure that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God: and ſo haue adioyned vnto it ſuch a minor as followeth, namely that no man hath
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2304:59"/> either in himſelfe, or of himſelfe, that perfect obedience, therefore &amp;c. it had beene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the purpoſe I confeſſe: but then their falſhood, would more eaſilie haue beene eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that made them to halt or at the leaſt to diſſemble in vſing this terme onely, in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and leauing at that other of himſelfe, of which alſo no doubt they meane it, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places inforce it very farre, and that in plaine tearmes &amp; audible voice, though here they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it not. For we, the faithful I mean, hauing the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and imputed vnto vs, haue it in our ſelues, though indeede not of our ſelues, and from the ſame reape ſingular conſolation and aſſurance, yea much more then from anie righteouſneſſe, wee haue or can haue of our owne. For our owne could be no better when it were at the beſt, then that which our firſt parentes had by creation, and yet wee ſee that notwithſtanding the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and integritie thereof, they were ſubiect to falling as the euent declared: but wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt, are free from that feare, that ſo hauing in that and manie other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2304:60"/> more then we loſt in Adam, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort might be the more large and certaine. By all which we may perceiue that the Maior, both in the words of it, and in their meaning is vntrue or at the leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſhort of that it ſhould, in that it excludeth or mentioneth not, the abſolute and perfect obedience of our Sauiour, with which beeing clothed, as if it were with the vnſpotted garment of our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother, we cannot chooſe but ſtand as pure and cleane in the ſight and preſence of Almightie God: As for the proofes adioyned to the propoſition, we confeſſe the trueth of them in themſelus: though we cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they are impertinently &amp; to no purpoſe alleadged or brought in here, for though we haue none of our owne, yet wee haue Chriſts abſolute obedience imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, which is as our owne, in as much as he is our head, and we his members, and he and we make but one bodie, in as much therefore as he is the perſon, with whome onely God is well pleaſed, and in whome alone he hath reconciled vs vnto himſelfe, accepting of his offring of himſelfe once for all, as a full and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2304:60"/> ſufficient price not onely to pay our debts, &amp; to redeeme vs out of priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to bring vs into the glorious liberty of the ſonnes of god we ſhould no more doubt of this, then if one hauing paid our debtes, we were ſure to be acquitted and diſcharged thereof: no not ſo much of this, as of that, becauſe men that haue ſatisfied for vs may demaund it againe, and moleſt vs if we pay it not: whereas our Sauiour Chriſt will not or cannot doe, in the exceeding pitie and compasſion of his loue towardes vs, any ſuch thing. And as for the places alleadged we aunſwere, that though in our faylings and fallinges we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not performed the thinges that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs, they may and doe make vs to doubt as in reſpect of our vnworthineſſe, yet neuer were they propounded by God to make vs doubt of, or diſtruſt his power, good will, &amp;c. towardes vs, but rather as to ſett out the abſolute righteouſneſſe that is in him and our manifold and continuall breaches of his lawe, ſo it may cauſe vs to go out of our ſelues, &amp; to fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him as a ſeuere iudge, and to runne vnto Ieſus Chriſt, who is placed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2304:61"/> betweene him and vs, not onely to remooue and take away all his wrath, but to purchaſe all his fauour, and ſo the lawe by that meanes, both in the light of it and in the threts of it, &amp; our breaking of it, &amp; euery way indeed become as the Apoſtle ſaith our <hi>ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to lead vs vnto Chriſt.</hi> And though that this may ſuffice for full anſwere vnto all, yet it liketh vs a little further to inlarge our ſelues herein. If our iuſtification before God and reconciliation with God, did depend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the lawe it ſelfe, or of the dignitie and worthineſſe of our workes, then the maior propoſition ſhould of necesſitie be true, but that cannot be becauſe the lawe is not giuen to iuſtifie but to condemne rather, and we knowe that all our righteouſnes, is as <hi>a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led cloath,</hi> &amp; ſo indeed we ſhould neuer ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude with our ſelues touching our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or finde peace of conſcience at home in our hearts. So that neither of thoſe beeing true the maior or propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot be ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or right. But ſith our iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before God, &amp; reconciliation with God is not of the law, or of the dignitie of our workes: but is from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2304:61"/> Chriſts abſolute obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: &amp; the holy goſpell which euery where teacheth, that Chriſt was therefore ſent and came into the world, that he might ſaue ſinners, and redeeming vs from the curſe of the lawe might make vs righteouſe through faith in him. The maior or propoſition, ſeparated as we ſee it is from Chriſt, and vnderſtood as it muſt be, and may appeare by the minor, not of Chriſts but of our obedience, can not be true. Beſids ſith the worde generally, and more particularly the Goſpel, a ſpeciall part of it, euery where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth vs, not to reſpect our owne dignity or worthineſſe (which indeed is none, but all manner of vnworthines) nor yet to beholde our owne vnworthineſſe otherwiſe then to humble vs before God and in our ſelues, and to make vs to runne vnto Chriſt and to his righteouſnes, more earneſtly &amp; ſpeedily then we do, but ſendeth vs vnto Chriſt and to his merite and worthineſſe, that ſo for his ſake we may be reconciled vnto God that is to ſay, both iuſtified and ſanctified before him and receiued vnto eternall life, there is no reaſon to receiue, but much and greate
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2304:62"/> reaſon to refuſe this minor, as vnſound inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, either vtterly excluding or els no whit at all mentioning Chriſt, who of god <hi>is made vnto vs wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſaluation, and in whome being iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through faith we haue peace towards god, &amp;c.</hi> Yea we ſay further, that ſith by the lawe righteouſnes cannot come vnto men, as the Apoſtle ſheweth in many places of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and namely in his epiſtles to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and Galathians, the doctrine of the Goſpell was therefore made manifeſt, that both it might diſcouer vnto vs, a meane, a manner, yea and matter of iuſtification, that in the lawe could not be found out, and alſo teach vs howe to appropriate and apply the ſame vnto our owne hearts. Laſtly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the minor we anſwere, and ſay that no man hath in himſelfe, as of himſelfe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lawe that they ſpeake of. Howebeit we are aſſured that all that haue Chriſt haue it, becauſe they doe by faith lay hold of Chriſt, and his perfect obedience: the want or lacke of then owne in themſelues, being ſo farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hindring Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2304:62"/> to them and in them, that it rather furthereth them thereto. For he that is filled with his owne can haue no part of Chriſts, the reaſon is becauſe he that is full, though it be but of airy and windie matter, or as we ſay bad repletions, can hardly or not at all till he be purged of that admit any more: but alſo becauſe there is ſuch a flat oppoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſts righteouſneſſe and mans, that they cannot both be, at one and the ſelfe ſame time, in one and the ſelfe ſame ſubiect: but the hauing of the one is the priuation of the other: as the Apoſtle ſheweth in many places of his writings, and namely Rom. 10. verſe 3. and alſo Rom. 11. verſe 5.6. Pſal. 3.6. And this me thinketh might ſatisfie any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea ſtoppe his mouth, from bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or bellowing againſt the trueth of God. Howebeit our aduerſaries, yet preſſe this point further and obiect ſaying: Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpell, <hi>If any man loue me he will keep my commandements</hi> or ſayings or wordes. But no man keepeth his word, therefore ſay they no man knoweth whether God loue him yea or no. Firſt for the forme of the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logyſmo:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2304:63"/> and then for the matter. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion there is more, then is in the promiſes. For whereas the maior teacheth vs, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Chriſts word, is a ſigne vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a pledge vnto our ſelues of ſome loues that God hath wrought in our hearts towards him: the concluſion turneth it vp ſide downe and ſaith, no man can know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God loue him yea or no, as though our loue &amp; Gods loue were all one; or as though God loued not many, I will not ſay vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life (for that loue onely belongeth to the elect) but in many outward reſpects, from which alſo as it ſhould ſeeme Chriſt himſelfe Math. 5. inferreth this doctrine, <hi>loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hate you &amp;c.</hi> And maketh this comfortable vſe of it, <hi>that you may be the children of your heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father: who can ſet his ſunne to ſhine, &amp; his raine to raine vpon the iuſt and vniuſt.</hi> Nowe to the matter. All the doubt reſteth in the true and naturall meaning of this phraſe keepe my words and ſayings. That our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould meane thereby abſolute obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and performance thereof, there is no likelyhood: for he that knewe the hearts of al
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2304:63"/> knew alſo that euen in the beſt, there were great defects and wants: and to haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch a ſpeech, I meane in that ſenſe and meaning had beene by his owne wordes, to haue croſſed and thuarted his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to haue ſpoken more indeede then truth was. Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what is it that he would ſignifie and ſet out vnto vs therby, ſurely this much that the care and conſcience that the faithfull had to obey his will, and theſe good beginnings and proceedings that they had made therein by his ſpirit, he would accept them as abſolute and couered with the fulnes of righteouſnes and obedience that was and is in himſelfe, and ſo preſent them in the ſight of his heauenly father. Neither doth that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like me, that one aunſwere hereto, namely that this beeing a ſentence or ſaying of the Goſpell, muſt not be vnderſtood of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fulfilling of the lawe of God, for that is a manner of ſpeech belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging rather to the law then to the Goſpell, but of faith and a good conſcience, or as we haur heard already the beginning and grooth in goodneſſe, that god by his word and ſpirit hath wrought in the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2304:64"/> heart. of the regenerate. For in this ſentence as it is a part and peece of the voice of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, theſe tearmes to keepe Chriſts ſaying or word, ſignifie nothing els but by faith to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and to hold faſt, the trueth and puritie of that doctrine, that in the Goſpell is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs, concerning Chriſt: and as ſound members of the Church to profeſſe it openly, and as faithfull miniſters to publiſh it &amp; ſpread it abroad, and all as men mindeful of and carefull for the glory of our God, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne and beutifie it, and to doe what we can in holy life to make it honourable. And ſo is it that Chriſt ſaith and meaneth alſo, Ioh. 17. where ſpeaking of his Apoſtles he affirmeth. <hi>That they kept the word of his heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And therefore alſo to ſuch, as after this manner imbrace the doctrine of the Goſpell and profeſſe it, beleeue it and obey it in ſome meaſure, are very large and excellent graces promiſed, as iuſtification, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and glorification, &amp;c. not becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect workes can merite or deſerue any more at Gods handes, then groſſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for as in regard of his abſolute iuſtice no
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2304:64"/> imperfect thing can pleaſe him, but becauſe that God, through his mercie and Chriſts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is pleaſed as to forgiue and forget our defects, ſo to crowne his owne graces in vs, and by theſe large promiſes and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances alſo to whett vs vnto perfection in this life, though indeed we can neuer here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereto. Now the maior beeing thus expounded: and theſe words to keep Chriſts ſayings beeing taken in this ſenſe in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or aſſumption, we doe not denie the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor as vntrue: becauſe Chriſt ſaieth of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Iohn 17. <hi>They haue kept thy word and all that they haue and doe,</hi> in ſort as before is expreſſed imbrace and hold faſt the doctrine of the goſpell, <hi>keeping faith and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith may rightly bee termed in their meaſure to keep Chriſts ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though he will not or dare not affirme they do it ſo well and in ſuch a large meaſure as the Apoſtle did.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Another argument they frame as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth He that by the Goſpell cannot know whether wee haue ſufficient repentance for his ſinnes, he cannot be aſſured tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2304:65"/> iuſtification or the grace of God tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards him, or concerning ſaluation, for God in the goſpell requireth repentance of vs. But no man by the goſpell can tell whether he haue ſufficient repentance yea or no: therefore no man, no not by the Goſpell knoweth or can knowe, concerning Gods grace towards him &amp; his owne ſaluation. There are many things in the maior propoſition, that had need of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation. Firſt, that word of ſufficient repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is not onely ambiguous and doubtfull, but full of vnſoundneſſe, as though forſooth our iuſtification before god, or reconciliation with him, ſtood vpon the dignitie, ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie and merite of our repentance, that is of our contrition, faith and new obedience, whereas we know it dependeth not vpon all or any of theſe things: but vpon the abſolute obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt, which as it is ſufficient indeede to take away all ſinne: ſo it is much more powerfull to ſupply the defect of the fruits of our faith. Or as though againe, we could ſufficiently and inough ſorrow for our ſinnes, whereas if we weigh not onely all our ſinnes, but any of them, in it owne nature, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2304:65"/> according to the grieuous effects it bringeth forth, or the heauie iudgement of god againſt vs for the ſame: we ſhall finde in our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in truth before god, that though wee would or could do nothing elſe all the daies of our liues, but repent vs of that one, yet wee could not ſufficiently performe it therefore. Or as though we had ſome ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie in our ſelues to all or any good thing, whereas the Apoſtle telleth vs, in plaine &amp; euident tearms, <hi>that vve are not ſufficient of our ſelues, as of our ſelues, to thinke anie thing, much leſſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but that all our ſufficiencie is of god, who worketh in vs both the will and the deed according to his good pleaſure:</hi> Secondlie wheras the maior affirmeth, that vnles a man haue ſufficient repentance for his ſinnes, he cannot be aſſured of iuſtification &amp;c. Wee aunſwer that is falſe. For though as in regard of that which is wanting in himſelfe he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be aſſured, yet as in regard of that which for him is ſupplied by another, and accepted of him; to whome that ſupplie was due, he may conceiue comfort and certainty alſo: for euen as when the debt that a man oweth, is ſatisfied
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2304:66"/> by his brother, &amp; the partie to whome it was due acknowledgeth himſelfe contented and paid, he that ought the debt, neede not doubt much leſſe diſtruſt, ſo is the caſe betweene god and vs, through the death &amp; obedience of Chriſt his ſonne &amp; our elder brother. For God confeſſeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſatisfaction when he ſaith: <hi>This is my wellbe loued ſonne in whome I am vvell plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp;c</hi> And <hi>Christ hath paied the debt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath put out the hand vvriting of ordinances that vvas againſt vs, vvhich was contrarie to vs, he euen tooke it out of the way and faſtened it vpon the croſſe, and hath ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led principalities and powers, and hath made a ſhevv of them openly and hath triumphed ouer them in the ſame croſſe.</hi> And why then ſhould we diſtruſt or doubt vnles we would ſuſpect the ſuffiencie of Chriſts obedience, or the abſolutenes of gods worke in giuing him to the death for vs all. Thirdly this is faulty in the maior, that it maketh it a principall part of the office of the Goſpell, to certifie mens hearts of repentance, whereas the chiefe due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the goſpell, is to publiſh forgiueneſſe of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2304:66"/> ſinnes, and by conſequent eternall life alſo, (for where the firſt is, the latter cannot chooſe but followe in the name and obedience of Ieſus Chriſt. And though we will not or cannot denie, but that repentance is a part of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and ioyned with the remisſion of ſinnes, yet is not therefore annexed therevnto, that in the worthines or ſuffiencie of it, we might merite aſſurance, but that in the hauing of it it might pledge vp in our hearts, the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all our tranſgresſions: and yet not as though it were of our ſelues, though it be in our ſelues, but as it is Gods worke in vs, he giuing this glorie to his owne worke, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie this fauour vnto our hearts of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and peace. Indeede if repentance were of and from man it were ſomewhat that they ſay: but beeing ſimplie and onely from God, (who if he doe not effectually bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mens ſtonie and hard hearts, they cannot return vnto him) they cannot think or ſpeake thus but with great ſinne againſt God, and their owne ſoules. Laſtly concerning the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the propoſition in theſe words.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2304:67"/> For God in the goſpell requireth repentance of vs, we confeſſe the truth of the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but not in their ſenſe, for that God demaundeth it no man I thinke will denie, becauſe euerie where almoſt it is ſaid, <hi>repent and beleeue the Goſpell</hi> But he that requireth it, for theſe ends &amp; purpoſes that theſe men imagine, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it ſhould puffe vs vp in pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of merit, that we ſhould thinke we haue it of our ſelues, and ſo therein aſſure our hearts, that is moſt falſe, but rather becauſe it commeth from God, and is the worke of his owne grace in vs, and appointed indeede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other fruits of our faith, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the weakenes and wants of it, which are from our ſelues &amp; not from god or his work in vs, and therefore may indeed comfort vs: for as this is a ſure rule, that whatſoeuer is of or from our ſelues, may iuſtly diſcourage vs, and cauſe vs to hang downe our heads for ſhame, and to caſt downe our hearts for feare: So this is as certaine that whatſoeuer is from God, may, and ought as in and of it ſelfe, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it is reuerently receiued and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed (notwithſtanding there be imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2304:67"/> in them that take and vſe the ſame) yeeld vnto vs ſingular conſolation. Hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the maior. Nowe for the minor. Wherevnto we anſwer that in the goſpell, the meaſure of repentance that is of contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, faith and new obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is not preſcribed, my meaning is, that there is not ſhewed how great or howe much our repentance ſhould be, but rather the thing it ſelfe, in it ſelfe &amp; the ſoundneſſe of it exacted or required. So that we may ſafelie ſay not the quantitie of it, as whether it be litle or great, ſuffiſeth: but the ſoundneſſe &amp; truth of it, ſuffiſeth, though not before God neither, for there is want in vs &amp; our good works that way, yet as in regard of our ſelues, and our owne aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for though it be not ſufficient, for our purpoſe or before God, yet it may ſuffice for another, and as in regard of our ſelues. For euen as not the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity ſo much as the quality of faith, in the truth and ſtedfaſtneſſe of it is it that in ſome ſorte commendeth vs to God, but ſpecially mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth much comfort to our owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And as not long and many praiers: but ſhort and ſweet as we may ſay, yea ſo do wee
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2304:68"/> ſay and beleeue alſo, touching all other fruits of our faith and namely our repentance. And let this ſuffice for this point.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Their eight argument they make thus: Pride is a vice diſpleaſing God, on the other ſide humilitie and modeſtie, is a vertue that he taketh delight in. But for a man to ſay, that he is in Gods fauour, and is aſſured of eternall ſaluation, is a point of arrogancie, as againe to doubt whether he be in Gods fauour, a token of modeſtie and humilitie. Therefore for a man to ſay that he is ſure he is in Gods fauour, is a ſoule fault, and to doubt of it, is a goodlie vertue. The maior of this propoſition is as cleare as posſible can bee, and to bee prooued by manie places of the Scripture, and particularly by this, <hi>God reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the prouds and giueth grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And therefore we ſay nothing to it, but willinglie yeeld and ſubmit our ſelues to the truth thereof. But the minor is corrupt and falſe and therefore wee denie it, in both the parts or propoſitions of it. For it is not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie to be aſſured generallie of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour for all mercies, and particularly of his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2304:68"/> grace concerning eternall ſaluation, ſith god himſelfe for the better vpholding of our hearts and hopes that way, hath beene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue vnto vs many gratious both proppes and promiſes in his worde, which alſo in good time he will performe vnto vs: as he hath done to many of his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, who haue gone before vs in the fleſh and in the faith. For this and not that is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie indeede to take that which doth not belong vnto vs, or to preſume of this or that which we haue not, and yet deceiued in our owne hearts imagine we haue it: or els hauing it, to be puffed vp with a conceite of hauing more then we inioy: or els inioying it to be proud of it, either as though we had not receiued it, or as though God had giuen it vs to that end to make vs ſwell ouer others But to aſſure our ſelues of Gods grace and of eternall life, is a doctrine that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in his word, for the good and ſtay of his owne people, as we haue already heard heretofore, and ſhould againe hereafter heare it prooued more at large, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can not arrogate or take any
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2304:69"/> more vnto our ſelues, then that that in regard of the free fauour of God belongeth vnto vs: and preſume here we cannot, or be proud, whether we haue it or haue not: for it were madneſſe to be lifted vp with that we haue not: and ſith we haue it not of our ſelues but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another: we may ſay as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>what haſt thou that ihou haſt not receiued, &amp; if thou haſt receiued it, why reioyceſt thou, as though thou hadeſt not receiued it.</hi> And again we knowe God giueth no graces to any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ende, howeſoeuer man in his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and Satan in his malice againſt him, abuſe them many times thereto, but as the graces themſelues are good, ſo both he in his purpoſe doth, and we in our practiſe ought to aime at good endes and effects, that ſo the one anſwering the other he might haue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good, and our ſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. On the other ſide it is not humilitie to doubt of Gods fauour, but diſtruſtfulnes or doubting rather, for humilitie, reſpecting not God, or not reaching vnto him, though it be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his eyes as other good thinges are, but concerning men, who when he conſidereth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2304:69"/> either himſelfe, his ſinne and miſery thereby or els God in his maieſtie, might, iuſtice, &amp;c. as a ſharp reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of the ſame hath iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be thrown downe is a holy &amp; bleſſed virgine, whereas diſtruſtfulneſſe or doubting ariſing from the corruption of our hearts and an imagination touching the height or heinouſnes of our iniquities, or ignorance of gods diuine nature and holy word, as though he could not or would not forgiue vs, is a foule vice becauſe it diſhonoureth God in the riches of his mercie, and addeth affliction vnto a fearefull and diſtreſſed ſoule. And both theſe points me thinketh we may ſee plaine by and earthly compariſon. For as when a great prince or perſon, that both hath large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of power and ſoundneſſe of good will, ſhal promiſe vs much, and wil vs in the word of a prince to aſſure our ſelues and be bolde, then to doubt were folly in our ſelues, and diſcredit to the perſon that offereth &amp; would performe ſuch ſingular fauour, ſo is it in this behalfe betweene vs and God, whoſe power we cannot doubt of, not onely becauſe it is abſolute and infinite, but alſo becauſe he hath
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2304:70"/> effectually in all ages and to euery perſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, whatſoeuer he hath faithfully promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed: and whoſe good will we may not call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion, he hauing giuen vs ſo many aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances thereof, as his ſweete promiſes the death of his ſonne, the pledge of his ſpirit and many particular graces both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: as he hath beene pleaſed to beſtowe vpon vs. So that we may ſee, it is not pride, but Chriſtian humilitie not onely to thinke or ſpeake lowely of, but as it were to diſtruſt yea condemne our owne deedes and workes and renouncing them vtterly to reſt and ſtay our ſelues vpon the mercy of God promiſed vnto vs for Chriſt our Sauiour his ſake, and alwaies both in minde and mouth to haue that worthy ſaying of the prophet riſe with vs: <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant O Lord, for then no fleſh ſhallbe righteouſe in thy ſight:</hi> and that of the Apoſtle 1. Cor. 4. <hi>I knowe nothing by my ſelfe and yet I am not iust or iuſtified for all that.</hi> One the other ſide it is not humilitie as they ſuppoſe, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie, and indeede contempt of God, and heauenly promiſes not to giue credit to or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2304:70"/> not to beleeue theſe ſweete promiſes. And therefore Saint Iohn ſaith: <hi>he that beleeueth not God hath made him a lier.</hi> 1. Iohn 5.10. and we may ſee a memorable example of it in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz. Iſaiah 7. who refuſed a ſigne giuen vnto him from god. But they preſſe this further &amp; ſay, it is a token of humilitie to acknowledge our infirmities and ſinnes. And who wil deny that that hath any fault or ſauour in him of godlines? But on the other ſide who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not that humilitie and doubting differ, as much as vice &amp; virtue: or what man vnles he were madde, not onely without reaſon but againſt godlineſſe, would ſuppoſe that our true humility, ſhould deſtroy confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, boldneſſe, or faith, concerning Gods grace, forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſith our humility is as other good things in vs, the fruite of the faith: If ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did ſoundly vnderſtand what humility were they would doubtleſſe be of another minde, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conclude ſo. This is humility not onely truly to feare God as a iudge, and ſo to acknowledge in his ſight our ſinnes, and infirmities, but alſo to fly vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and to ſtay in his al ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2304:71"/> ſatisfaction. Doth this ouerthrowe a poore mans pouertie, that he beggeth an almes for Gods ſake as we ſay? or doth this deſtroy a weake mans weakneſſe, that he ſeeketh for ſhelter and defence at the handes of the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g? or doth this take away a ſicke mans ſicknes, that he laieth it open to the Phiſition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth medicine? no verely but rather argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, pouerty, weakneſſe, ſickneſſe, &amp;c. And ſo doth our humility. But let vs go forward.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The ninth argument is this. Where there is vnworthineſſe, there cannot be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods grace, of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and of ſaluation, but ſtill there muſt be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are turned to God there is great vnworthineſſe, whileſt they knowe not whether they haue ſufficiently and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily prepared themſelues, and performed all the couenants and conditions that God hath preſcribed therefore, &amp;c. The propoſition or maior of this argument is very falſe, becauſe the beholding or feeling of our own vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, doth no more worke doubting, much leſſe diſtruſtfulneſſe in the hearts of Gods people, then feeling of outward wants,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2304:71"/> maketh naturall men careleſſe of a ſupply. It is a grace of God to be well acquainted with our owne vnworthineſſe, yea ſuch a grace as God onely beſtoweth vpon his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that ſo in the beholding and ſight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they may more earneſtly ſeeke after, and be more fruitfully made partakers of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding riches of his mercy, wheras the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the world, are either ceaſed with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medneſſe and ſenſleſneſſes of their owne vnworthineſſe: and good reaſon thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feele not ſinne, or els ſee it in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and condemnation: and good reaſon of it alſo, becauſe rather they haue made no account to profit by Gods mercies, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them rather to licentiouſneſſe and ſinne. And that we might be the better aſſured of the trueth of this point, namely that the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the indignity of gods people hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrought doubting in themſelues, nor cauſed god the leſſe, but more rather to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme them: we haue many memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but for the preſent we will content our ſelues with one out of the ould teſtament and another out of the newe, that ſo ſeeing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2304:72"/> the conſent of ſcriptures and the confirmitie of this trueth in all ages, we may the better beleeue it, both for the comfort of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: and ſtopping the mouthes of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. In the 18. of Geneſis, the ſpirit preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this in the prayer of Abraham that he made for Sodom, Gomorrah, &amp;c. that he ſaid he was but <hi>duſt and aſhes,</hi> and how could he more debaſe and humble himſelfe? and yet he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth afterwards his prayer againe &amp; againe, which had his heart beene poſſeſſed with doubting, and vpheld with hope he could not haue performed. And in the 8. of the goſpell after Mathew, the Centurio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that came to intreat Chriſt for his ſeruant ſicke of the palſie and grieuouſly pained, feeling and confesſing his owne vnworthineſſe, <hi>that he was not vvorthy that Chriſt ſhould come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his roofe,</hi> doth not only make Chriſt him ſelfe as he was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to maruaile at it, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth for the better comforting of all that haue the like ſenſe, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him &amp; to ſay verely I haue not found ſo great faith no not in Iſrael: &amp; what meaneth that generall ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the word, <hi>god reſisteth the proud &amp;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2304:72"/> giueth grace to the humble,</hi> confirmed by the example of the Phariſe &amp; Publican Luke eighteene. But to teach vs this point? Can a man be truely humbled in himſelfe, without ſight and ſenſe of his owne vnworthineſſe? or can he taſt or tell how ſweet the Lord is in his mercies, that is not wel acquainted with his owne miſeries? If anie man thinke ſo he is fowly deceiued. Nay we will ſay more, that where vnworthines is moſt felt, there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto godlie men the beſt meanes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetie and aſſurance, not onely becauſe the Scripture ſaith: <hi>where ſinne hath abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ther grace hath abounded much more:</hi> but becauſe God in his purpoſe, and indeed aſſured good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will calleth vs out of our ſelues, who are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether weaker then water, that ſo we might wholy repoſe our wofull ſoules vpon him, that is the god of our comfort, and the vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable rock of our ſtrength. Wherefore wee ſee that the maior is vtterly vntrue. As for the firſt part of the aſſumption or minor we will not denie it, namely that euen in the faithfull there is not onely is great vnworthines, but a very good taſt and feeling thereof. And good
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2304:73"/> reaſon there is it ſhould be ſo, they beſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their owne waies, they beſt examine their owne hearts &amp;c. Neither will we much ſtick with them to yeeld them the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of it, namely that theſe are good meanes to make euen god feele their vnworthines, that they doe not rightly, and reuerently prepare themſelus to the ſeruice of god, that they full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill not al, nay not any in ſort as they ſhould, of the couenants, conditions, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of god &amp;c. but that they ſhould worke doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in them of gods goodnes &amp; grace tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards them, that is the point we deny, and they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer prooue: for doubting is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; peculiar effect of the ſight and ſenſe of vnworthines in the Saints of God, but haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather vnto the Lord, that ſo in him that accounteth them worthy of euery thing, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him alone they may bee repleniſhed with his aboundant mercy. Onely that word ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently &amp; worthily which here &amp; els where they vrge ſo much, in the ſenſe that they vſe it &amp; to the purpoſe that they apply it, we vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſlike, for the grace of God in our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſaluation &amp;c. doth not depend vpon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2304:73"/> our ſufficiency &amp; worthines (which indeed is none if we reſpect our ſelus, as we haue heard ſundry times already) but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the free &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe of god, &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the abſolut &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merite of Chriſts obedience. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed, are the promiſes publiſhed, and therefore alſo is the ſonne of God become &amp; made our mediatour &amp; interceſſour, becauſe we are vtterly vnworthy of al or any fauour, (whereas if we had worthines in and of our ſelues theſe things had bin needles) &amp; that for his ſake, &amp; through his obedience the father might declare himſelf to be gracious &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto vs: according vnto which it is ſaid. Romaines the 8. <hi>There is no condemnation, to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus. &amp;c.</hi> So that we may ſee, that a godlie hart, will eaſilie confeſſe yea ought indeed to acknowledge, both that he is vnworthie (which he cannot chooſe but doe; if he conſider well Gods iuſtice, his owne daylie and hourely tranſgresſions eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manner of way &amp;c.) and that yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he ought ſtedfaſtly to beleeue the promiſes of the Goſpell, and namely this, that beeing truely penitent, wee are for Chriſts

            <p n="10">10 Their tenth argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they frame thus: where there is infirmitie and weakeneſſe of faith, there cannot be an aſſured perſwaſion, hope and boldneſſe. But in them that are turned to God, there is great infirmitie and weakeneſſe of faith: therefore men cannot be aſſuredly certified, of Gods fauour, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their ſinnes, eternall ſaluation &amp;c. We cannot but deny the maior propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this ſillogiſme. And leaſt we ſhould ſeeme to do it, without good cauſe why, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you marke that that followeth. Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith and certainety of faith are not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite or contrary, for weakeneſſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, of one and the ſelfe ſame thing may be in one and the ſelfe ſame ſubiect, at one and the ſelfe ſame time, becauſe they are diuerſe and not contrarie, but the oppoſite or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to infirmitie and weakenes is ſtrength.

Yea one and the ſelfe ſame godlie man, as in reſpect of ſundrie times, and diuerſe occaſions may be ſaid to be ſtrong in this holie vertue, and weake alſo. What a faith was this in Peter, by Chriſts comfortable wordes not onely to expell feare but in the ſtrength and power of Chriſts ſpeach vnto him and ſaying, <hi>Come, to vvalke vpon the vvater?</hi> And yet what weakeneſſe was this in ſeeing of a winde to be afraied &amp;c. God making vs in him to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this trueth, that while wee looke vpon him through Chriſt, we are ſtrong and bold as a lion, but when we leaue vpon our ſelues, or the arme of fleſh and blood, or regard ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, wee are as weake as water and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſinke. Therefore in the maior propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee may well and eaſilie perceiue, that they neither deale plainely with the cauſe.

And good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould be ſo, for the additame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto nature as it was created, in an alteration and changing of the firſt nature, as we may ſee euen by this particular if we had no more that for the ſinnes of man, the creatures and particularly the earth is liable to the curſe of barrenneſſe, &amp;c. which without that it could not haue beene, and yet notwitſtanding this additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, theſe things by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of propagation- are eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ightly named natural. And this we might inlarge and prooue by many other particulars, that howeſoeuer at their firſt producing or bringing forth they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be againſt nature and monſtrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, yet by propagation and continuance of time, are reckoned amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt naturall things. So that we may nowe ſee howe the maior is true, and howe it is vntrue. For the minor it is true, ſinne bringing that many other feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things into the world, and the ſame tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugh the taint of originall vnrighteouſneſſe beeing ſpread ouer all fleſh: howebeit that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2304:78"/> will not followe therevpon, nor out of the maior that is concluded that therefore doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cannot be altered. For though as in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of nature vitiated, and man himſelfe tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, there can be no alteration or change made, but rather ſtill an increaſe of corruption, by reaſon of that ſtrength and power of original ſin, and the reliques of it in vs, yet as in regard, of God, who onely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth wonderfull thinges both in heauen and earth according to his good pleaſure and to whome alone it belongeth as to ſearch the hearts and reines, ſo to make of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and corrupt heart of man, purging it ſo by faith that it ſhall be free from the power of iniquitie, and ſanctified alſo vnto many good workes. And ſo by all this we ſee the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infirmitie of this argument, which they themſelues feeling &amp; fearing alſo; preſſe it yet a little further thus. Euen thoſe naturall
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2304:78"/> things which are added to nature created are immutable or vnchangeable. But doubting euen after this ſort is naturall therefore after this manner or ſort this doubting alſo is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. But that we knowe Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be ſuch that the wicked ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from euill to worſe, that ſo heaping vp their owne ſinnes: they might heape vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them more iuſt and ſwift condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhould wonder at this, that men turne the truth of God into a lie, to their own and other mens hurt alſo. For firſt the maior or propoſition is not true in one ſenſe, as hath beene ſhewed before, for though it be true, that in this deprauation &amp; corruption of our nature, naturall things indeed by the ſtrength and power of nature are vnchangeable: the reaſon is becauſe nature ſo deformed, cannot ſet a foot forward to reformation or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſelfe, but rather will proceed in the power of the corruption of it, and ſpecially alſo when it is egged forward with Satans malice, from euill to worſe yet that hindreth not, but by the doctrine of the Goſpel, which is the power of god to ſaluation to euery one
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2304:79"/> that beleeueth, and by many other meanes and helpes, as particularly the gratious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his bleſſed ſpirit: this worke of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and altering our nature, not onely may but as we ſee by former and daily experience is brought to paſſe: for as nothing could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, but further him rather, when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now can ſtoppe his worke, but ſhal fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther it rather, in chaunging that curſed and corrupted nature of ours. So that though this be true that by force and power of nature they cannot be remooued or changed, yet that letteth not but that this alſo may be true, that by Gods word outwardly and by his ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſpirit inwardly accompanying &amp; making the ſame fruitefull they may in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue by little and little, not onely be altered and changed, but at the laſt be vtterly cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged which is more. And as for the minor or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption we ſay that in this ſenſe and after this ſort, namely that not as nature was firſt created of God, for ſo it could not chuſe but be as he is exceedingly good, but as after the fal of our firſt parents it was deriued and couei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2304:79"/> ouer vnto vs, that ſo to doubt of the grace and fauour of God for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, for the ſauing of our ſoules &amp;c. is very naturall indeede, that is to ſay, that in and through this deprauation and corruption of that excellent nature, which by creation was infuſed into our firſt parents, and in them to all their poſteritie, had they continued therin becauſe we are all in their loines to haue bene partaker of their excellent graces by creation as well as we are of their ſinne by tranſgresſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men do doubt of God, his goodneſſe, &amp;c. And though as in regard of men naturall, or facultie or power that they haue in them as of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we acknowledge it impoſible to alter or change this doubting and diſtruſtfulneſſe, yet by God to whome all things ar posſible, and by his ſingular helpe aide, and grace,, it is not onely in his owne people much altered in this life, though the worke be wrought by little and little, and as it were by certen ſteps and degrees, but in them ſhall be vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and taken away, in the life that is for to come, God working it here but in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and there in abſolutenes and perfection
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2304:80"/> not becauſe he is not able here to doe it, for what is he not able to performe to ſhewe what hindra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we haue in our ſelues againſt his gratious workes, partly from our ſelves and partly from Satans malice, and alſo that he might inſtruct vs with holy deſires to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after the life to be reuealed, where is indeede the abſolute perfection and fulneſſe of our felicity. But they ſay further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this point. The Saintes and people of God doe ſometimes fall into doubting concerning gods grace and their own ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to that end they alleadge Pſal. 33. &amp; Habac. 1. We graunt it neither neede they indeed to prooue it, for the experience that God hath giuen vs of others &amp; of our ſelues doth plainly ſhew the ſame. But what would they infer? that therefore it is good and lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? Surely there will no ſuch thing followe. To reaſon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome facts or affections of the godly is not right, for ſo in Noah we might dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, from Dauids adultery, we might approoue of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s filthines, from Peters fal, we might iuſtifie other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s feare, &amp;c. The reaſon whereof is plaine and euident. Our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2304:80"/> regeneration as other ſpirituall graces that God vouchſafeth vs in this life as knowledge, faith, obedience &amp;c. is but in part. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the remainders of ſinn the fleſh alſo lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting yea riſing vp againſt the ſpirite, it falleth out that many times we doe not onely leaue vndone the good we ſhould performe, but accompliſh alſo the euill that god hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs to do. And that not only in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts of our hearts, to which we muſt refer doubting and diſtruſtfulnes, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the words of our mouths and works of our hands alſo: and therefore not ſafe to follow the example of Gods Saints either in inward or outward thinges, further then as they themſelues are ſanctified and walke in the obedience of the word, and tread in the holy ſteppes of God. And this the Apoſtle meaneth when he ſaith. Epheſ. 5. <hi>Be yee follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God as deare children, and walke in loue euen as Chriſt hath loued vs:</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lher place. <hi>Be yee follovvers of me euen as I am of Chriſt.</hi> firſt to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eleuen. By which we ſee that though the faithfull fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doubting, yet they do it not as in reſpect of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2304:81"/> the graces of God, which they haue receiued, but as in regard of the remainders of fleſh &amp; corruption in them vnreformed. And yet ſo as they do oppoſe and ſet themſelues what they can and higge and wreſtle with their doubting by ſetting againſt the ſame, holie and heauenlie thoughts, of gods free grace &amp; gracious promiſes, as alſo the ſtrength and power of the holie ſpirit of God, prouoking them as they are regenerate to manie good works and particularly to praier, by meanes whereof that which is faint and weake in and of themſelues may bee ſtrengthened, as wee may ſee in the father of the poſſeſſed child. Mark. 9. <hi>Lord I beleeue, help myne vnbeleefe.</hi> and by the Apoſtles beſeeching God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their faith: this aſſurance of their harts concerning fauour from God and ſaluation, beeing a fruite of their faith and a worke of Gods ſpirite in them, without which indeede they can neuer attaine therevnto, and that doubting that they finde and feele, flowing from the remainders of their corruption, as yet vnregenerated. But as men that are in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth, and cannot tell which way to get out
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2304:81"/> do more and more inwrappe themſelues, ſo fareth it with theſe perſons, oppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the truth of God, and aſſaying to defend the errors and corruptions of their owne hearts. For as though that which they haue ſaid already had not beene mirie and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie inough, they yet vrge more claye and dongue drawne out of the beaſtlie puddle of their owne hearts. Thus therefore they yet preſſe and vrge this point. Naturall thinges, that is ſuch things, as we haue naturally in our minds are not ſinne: but doubting is naturall: therefore it is not ſinne? we aunſwer to the propoſition or maior by diſtinguiſhing. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things are of two ſortes, that is either ſuch, as we had firſt from God by creation &amp; remaine ſome of them in vs as yet vntainted, are not ſinne, as for example, our feare, our loue &amp;c. ſimply and in themſelues conſidered, as it is not ſinne in it ſelfe to haue that pasſion of feare, or that affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of feare, as to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp;c. ſo that they be freed from extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuch things in the conſiderations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed, are not to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ſimply ſinne or euill. But there are ſome things nowe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2304:82"/> counted naturall, which haue both come v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon &amp; preuailed vpon, the puritie of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it was in creation, as for example ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce in ſteed of our knowledge, doubting or diſtruſtfulnes in ſtead of our hope &amp;c. and theſe cannot chooſe but be euill: for euen as our creation, and all the things we had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in comming from God, made vs to be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated good, becauſe nothing could come from him but that which was good. So theſe proceeding from a contrary fountaine, that is Satan and his malice, cannot chooſe but be of the ſame nature, that he is of, that is euil &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning doubting ſay, that it is naturall indeed, but not as from our firſt creation, for then it ſhould haue beene good, but came vnto our nature after the fall, and ſo beeing depraued is euill, ſpecially when it is referred to God as in all this queſtion it is: for though when wee haue to deale with men, ſpecially ſuch, as whome for their wayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, inconſtancie, &amp; other corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that we our ſelues haue had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of, we haue iuſt cauſe, by reaſon of their badd dealing, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, feare, &amp; doubt, &amp; doubting there or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2304:82"/> can not be ſaid to be ſinne or euil: yet as in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of God, who not onely in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is alwaies like vnto himſelf, free from the leaſt ſhaddow or ſhew of turning that may be, but as in regard of his action and practiſe towards all his people in all ages, hath manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted himſelfe powerful and faithful; as their is no reaſon to doubt, ſo wee cannot doe it, but with diſhonour to his maieſty, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent alſo with ſinne to our owne ſoules. But let vs proceed.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Their 12. argument is this. No man can certainely conclude, that the holy ghoſt hath kindled or wrought in him faith and other vertues: the reaſon is, becauſe they may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpring from humane reaſon.

Theſſ. 3. ſaying, <hi>all men haue not faith:</hi> therefore it is naturall, or of nature and then by conſequent it muſt needs be of God: which yet alſo is warranted vnto vs by plaine texts of Scripture, as Philipp. 1. <hi>Vnto you it is giuen for Chriſt, that not onely yee ſhould beleeue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> And againe, Rom. 10. where he ſaith, <hi>how they call on him in vvhome they haue not beleeued: hovv ſhall they beleeue in him, of vvhome they haue not heard? &amp; how ſhall they heare without a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher &amp;c.</hi> And if faith from whence all good works flow, be the gift of god, then muſt alſo good workes themſelues come from him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe if the firſt be from him, the ſecond likewiſe. And yet leaſt we ſhould thinke, that this were not Gods owne, and according to his truth, but a humane inuention, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that attributeth the worke of faith vnto God aſcribeth alſo al other vertues in vs vnto
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2304:84"/> him. For that muſt euer be true the Apoſtle ſpeaketh Philip. 2. <hi>It is God who worketh in vs both the will &amp; the deed according to his good pleaſure.</hi> and Epheſ. 2. <hi>We are his workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good works, which god hath ordained that we ſhould walke in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For otherwiſe if we reſpect our ſelues, in this behalfe. I meane of doing good works as from nature, wee muſt ſay as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, there is none that doeth good no not one, they are become all corrupt and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, or as the Apoſtle ſaith elſe where, <hi>not that we are ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke a good thought</hi> (which is the beginning of a good work) <hi>but all our ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy is from god.</hi> Nay which is more, when God hath begunn good thinges in vs, wee doe what wee can through the remainders of our corruption either vtterly to deface them, or ſo by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cleauing vnto them to taint them, that were they not ouerſhadowed, with the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute righteouſnes of Chriſt, we and they both might iuſtly be reiected from god. And there fore he that knoweth either nature or grace, God or man, his word or the world, cannot
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2304:85"/> but certenly conclude, that faith and all other vertues are from God, by his ſpirite, and not from man in his nature, euen as Saint Iames chap. 1. in a generall ſentence affirmeth it, <hi>Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good giuing, and euerie perfect gift, is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of lights.</hi> And the proofe or confirmation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to this propoſition it ſelfe, for neuer was it heard in the ſchoole of god, or among ſound chriſtians, that faith and good works, might ſpring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humane reaſon. For which purpoſe notable is that ſpeach of our Sauiour Chriſt vnto Peter, after the worthy confesſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he had made, ſaying, <hi>thou art that Chriſt, that ſonne of the liuing God,</hi> vnto whome Chriſt ſaieth againe. <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon the ſonne of Ionah, for fleſh and blood hath not reuealed this vnto thee, but my father which is in heauen.</hi> Matth. 16. To the ſame ende alſo tendeth that that the Apoſtle ſaith. 1. Corinth. 2. <hi>But the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto him, neither can he know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ar ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And what ſhould Saint Paule meane elſe when Rom. 8.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2304:85"/> he ſayeth, <hi>the wiſdome of the fleſh is death:</hi> and againe, <hi>the wiſdome of the fleſh is emnitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt god,</hi> for it is not ſubiect to the lawe of God, neither indeed can be, but that it is not in the vnderſtanding, will, or power of man, to knowe loue or obey the good things of god, till he be inlightned, ſtrengthened and inabled from aboue? And if it were ſo that theſe good thinges doe ſpring from humane reaſon, why doe we not refuſe or forſake the worde: and reſiſt the working of gods holy ſpirit, as thinges needleſſe and vnneceſſarie? or why doe we ſay the Heathen and Gentiles are voide of faith, and good workes, ſeeing they haue as much of nature and humane reaſon as we or any other. And beſides the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our own hearts will ſhewe vs the vanity &amp; falſhood both of the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it: for in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to god or repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, we ſenſibly feele both the one &amp; the other, namely faith: without which we could not convert, it ſealing vp in our hearts the forgiuenes of our ſinnes for Chriſts ſake: &amp; the holy ghoſt quickening &amp; ſtirring vs vp, as to that ſo to other good works beſides: according to which S. Paul. faith Rom. 5, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2304:86"/> 
               <hi>beeing iuſtified through faith, we haue peace towards God.</hi> And Rom. 8. <hi>The ſpirit that is the holyghoſt witneſſeth vnto our ſpirits, that we are the children of god.</hi> And therefore Auguſtine (though indeed I doe not greatly delight in allegation of humane authorities) in a certaine place ſaith well, <hi>he that beleeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knoweth that he beleeueth, to witte, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt that in the feares &amp; terrours of his heart and conſcience, God is pleaſed to make him feele conſolation and comfort:</hi> for they that acknowledge and conſent vnto the trueth of Gods word, and by ſerious thinking vpon, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable feeling of the promiſes of the Goſpel vphold their hearts and hope, they in whatſoeuer eſtate or diſteeſſe they be, yea though they walke in the valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of death, or as we ſay in the middeſt of death it ſelfe, they haue experience of, and ſenſibly feele conſolation. Whereby we may ſee, that when a man hath an aſſured perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, or a ſound and ſteadfaſt faith, there follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth a certaine ſenſe and feeling of comfort and ioy, according to which it is ſaid, 2. Chro. 20. <hi>Put your truſt in the Lord your god, and yee
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2304:86"/> ſhall be aſſured.</hi> And theſe motions, ſenſes or feelings, are not certainely of humane reaſon, or of fleſh and blood as we ſay, for then they ſhould be in all men alike, or els nature ſhould be an vnequall diſtributer of her fauours, and they ſhould be propped alſo vp with ſome outward experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but that is not ſo, for they are ſtaied vpon the word &amp; promiſe of God, &amp; that not only without reſpect of outward and naturall things, but euen contrary to the reaſon of nature and fleſh: which as we may ſee in the ſufferings of the Saintes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome of Gods people, who ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne through fire and water being ſupported with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of a mighty perſwaſion from God, of which the wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this world know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: ſo we may behold it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Abraham the friend of God, and the father of the faithful, who not once and away as we ſay in the matter of his owne withered body, and his wife Sarahs barren wombe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="13">13 There remaineth the thirteenth or laſt argument, which they vſually make for the maintenance of their corrupt doctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching doubting, which though it come in the laſt place hath as little force, as any of the former, if not leſſe. And they frame it after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. The doctrine that begetteth or brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth carnall careleſneſſe and fleſhly ſecurity, is not to be commonly propounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the people. The doctrine that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth certainty and aſſurance of ſaluation and Gods grace concerning the ſame, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold fauours beſides, in very many begetteth and bringeth forth carnall ſecurity, therefore though it were true in it ſelfe, yet it is not to deliuered vnto the people. We aunſwere firſt vnto the maior, that look what doctrine in and of it ſelfe, breedeth or bringeth forth ſuch badde effects, it ſhould at no hand be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, becauſe men through their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Satans malice prone &amp; ready enough to ſinne and condemnation, ſhould not by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2304:87"/> falſe &amp; erronious opinions in themſelues, or by dangerous conſequences from them, be thruſt headlongly into eternal iudgement. As for example, the doctrine of mens merites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Papiſts, and the ſatisfying of ſinne &amp; deliuerie of ſoules, ſpecially out of purgatory by maſſes, diriges, trentalles, &amp;c. becauſe in their owne nature, they make men preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and careleſſe alſo, whileſt by other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their ſinnes may be anſwered &amp; Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſatisfied, ſhould not be either publikely or priuatly propounded: and the ſame may we affirme of all other doctrines of the like nature. But if there be any true and holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, vpon which this blame lighteth or is ſaid through the malice and tranſgresſion of men; or by occaſion as we ſay, or through the fault, negligence, or ignorance of them that abuſe it, or are offended at it or by it, there is no reaſon it ſhould be ſilent or dumme as we may ſay, then that the ſunne ſhould be taken from vs, becauſe it annoyeth ſore eyes, yea ſometime increaſeth th infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the plague, by reaſon of the badde bodies that be tainted therewith: or that meate and drinke ſhould
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2304:88"/> be with held from all, becauſe ſome eate to ſurffetting and drinke to drunkenneſſe. To make this plain by ſome examples out of the word. What is more ſweete then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Gods grace? And yet becauſe ſome turne it into wantonneſſe, as in the Apoſtles time and our daies, ſhall it not therefore be heard ſound in the Churches of God? what is more comfortable then the doctrine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuneſſe of ſinnes through Chriſts obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? And yet becauſe ſome then and nowe adaies alſo hearing this that where ſinne hath abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there grace hath abounded much more, did and doe ſhameleſly and graceleſly vtter theſe wordes: let vs continue in ſinne that grace may abound, ſhall not therefore this be propounded vnto the people. The like may we ſaie of this point controuerted It were to much indignity and diſhonour offered vnto God to make his truth ſubiect vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And it were to much iniury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice to men ſpecially to the Godly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them to thoſe, that mourne in Sion, to haue with held from their eies, eares and hearts: the very life of their ſoules, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2304:88"/> halfe as we may ſay of the goſpel, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I meane of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. For as this is true, that the abuſing of true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, doth not aboliſh the doctrine it ſelfe, becauſe it is ſure and permanent euen as God the author thereof is, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be bettered or made worſe be humane corruption, ſpecially as in regard of it owne nature: ſo this is certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, that in al godly wiſdome and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, rather the abuſe of it ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, then the doctrine it ſelfe with held: or if that cannot be, yet the ſame deliuered with ſuch holy cautions: as in reſpect of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that they be charged in the name of the Lord Ieſus, but to lay vncleane or violent handes vpon the ſacred trueth of God not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto them, and ſuch comfort to the godly, that it ſhould rather ſpeake in a cleare and loud voice, then be mute and dumbe as we ſay in the Church. And this beſides that it is gods owne ordinance, and therfore ſhould preuaile, it is more equall in all vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore alſo to be imbraced. To the minor affirming that the doctrine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching certenty of ſaluation &amp;c. maketh men
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2304:89"/> ſecure and careleſſe, we anſwere that it is not ſo, if they conſider the doctrine either as it commeth from God, or in it ſelfe or owne nature, for ſo it giueth great glory vnto God to whome alone belongeth mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, and miniſtreth much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto vs, whileſt the aſſurance of theſe things (as we ſee by the truth of the doctrine) dependeth not vpon our ſelues, but vpon God alone: otherwiſe if they regard it, in the fault of men abuſing the ſame, as we will not deny, but that ſome there are that ſo abuſe it, ſo yet we cannot conſent vnto this, that for this their foule fault and ſinne, other men that haue better grace ſhould be puniſhed, with the wante or lacke of this trueth of God, no more then we would approoue of this, that becauſe in ſome great perſons houſe, one is giuen to drunkenneſſe, and another to gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandiſe therfore they that ſoberly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly vſe the ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of the family ſhould not haue meate or drinke, or that daiely allowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which they were wont to inioy. But indeed it were much more ſafe and equall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to expell them that doe ſo ſinne in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2304:89"/> leaſt their euill example might infect others, or elſe, to haue ſome when they eate and drinke, to put them in minde to put a knife vnto their throats, or to allowe them leſſe, that ſo they might not by abuſing of Gods creatures, increaſe their owne ſinne, and hale iudgement vpon the whole houſe. And the like maye wee affirme of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God, which is or at the leaſt ſhould bee the ſpirituall foode, and drinke of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>And thus hitherto, wee haue not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly largelie but truelie I am ſure aunſwered, whatſoeuer they haue obiected, at the leaſt wiſe, the moſt materiall and forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that they make, either to vpholde their owne vanitie or errour, or to aſſault the inuiolable, and inuincible trueth of God. Nowe there remaineth an aunſwer to ſuch places, as they cite or quoate out of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers or Doctours of the Church: which labour ſpecially as in regard of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, who are not well acquainted with their writinges, wee might verie well ſpare were it not that wee would glady ſtoppe the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2304:90"/> mouthes of their aduerſaries, in all that they do or can bring for themſelues, whether it be in ſubſtance or ſhew. How be it herein to put downe euery particular place &amp; doctor, that they vſe or abuſe rather I minde not: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it would bee infinitely tedious, it would bee alſo vnneceſſarie or ſuperfluous: for the aunſwering of one or two, all the reſt ſaying nothing at the leaſt-wiſe for matter, though now and then they varie in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but what others haue ſaid, ſhallbe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of them all. And therefore it ſhallbe beſt herein, to be as ſhort as wee may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, yet as plaine as posſiblie we can, that ſo the trueth of the Lord may breake forth, and be imbraced in her glorie.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt father that they doe alleadge is Auguſtine, and out of him a place in his 23. tractat. vpon Iohn, wher he ſaith. <hi>The minde is toſſed betweene hope and deſpaire: It is to be feared leaſt hope hurt or kill thee, that whileſt thou hopeſt much concerning gods mercy, thou ſhouldſt fall into his iudgement. And againe it is to be feared, leaſt deſperation ſhould deſtroy thee, that whileſt thou thinkeſt the great and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2304:90"/> grieuous ſinnes vvhich thou haſt committed, are not pardoned, thou ſhouldſt not repent and ſo incurre his iudgement.</hi> We may frame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe aunſwers to this place. As for example when he ſaith, <hi>it is to be feared leaſt hope hurt thee &amp;c.</hi> He vſeth the name of hope, not in his good and naturall meaning, as it is both v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and preſſed vpon vs in the holie Scripturs but by abuſion, as S. Iames doth the word of <hi>faith</hi> in his ſecond chapter, or elſe according to that conceit or imagination that theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure men had of that which in themſelues they tooke to be hope. And though this bee true and may ſufficiently aunſwer the place, yet further I ſay that Auguſtin in theſe words doth not ſpeak ſimply againſt chriſtian hope, for that had beene to haue condemned that, which the holy ghoſt hath commended, and to haue diſprooued that which he approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in many places of the word, but againſt ſuch a conceited hope (if I maye giue it the name of hope) or idle conceit rather &amp; ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming imagination, as maketh men ſecure, careleſſe and negligent in the obedience or keeping of gods commaundements. For firſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2304:91"/> this is Auguſtins drift and purpoſe, namely to admoniſh men of boldnes or licenciouſnes in ſinning which ariſeth in men, either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a falſe hope of eaſily obtaining pardon or els fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the contrary, that is diſtruſt of ſaluation, or from imagination that ſinne is but ſome light and trifling thing. And that this is his meaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it may appeare by ſome ſpeaches, that goe not much before theſe that our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries alleadge, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith: wherefore from either of them, that is to ſay both hoping and deſpairing (which are contrarie affections men are in daunger.) By hoping a man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued when he ſaieth God is good, God is mercifull, I will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth me or liketh me, I will giue my luſts the reines, and lay the bridle in their necke. Why ſo? becauſe God is mercifull gracious &amp;c. Theſe men are in daunger of hope. As they on the other ſide of deſperation, who when they haue fallen into grieuous ſinnes &amp;c. as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the father. By which we may ſee what manner of hope it is that he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the certainetie, which wee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures teach, is to bee fixed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2304:91"/> in Chriſt alone, and his merits, or Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie through him, and which for the certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and aſſuredneſſe of it, is ſaid in the word, to bee as it were the anchor of the ſoule both ſure and ſtedfaſt: but ſuch a one, as al they that abuſe Gods grace vnto wantonnes, and ſinne, do wickedly forge &amp; frame vnto themſelues. To bee ſhort he ſhutteth vp in this place or matter, with the wordes of Chriſt vnto the adulterous woman: Neither doe I condemne thee. But beeing made ſure for that which is paſt, be heedy for things to come; neither will I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne thee, for ſome ſmale good that thou haſt omitted: keep that which I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee, that ſo thou maiſt haue performed that which I haue promiſed thee. By which wordes appeareth, that he mindeth not here to eſtabliſh doubting or diſtruſtfulneſſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſaluation, neither yet to deliuer any thing againſt the aſſured hope of our ſoules (for if he had done ſo he had ſpoken againſt the trueth of God and his word) but that he laboureth to remooue the one, and indeed to eſtabliſh &amp; confirme the other, whileſt he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaieth as to humble the hard &amp; ſtony harted,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2304:92"/> ſo to inſtruct the tender and afflicted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which he would not or could not haue done, if he had meant to haue approoued of diſtruſt or doubting: for how can the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence buffeted and beaten with feare, receiue conſolation thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly they alleadge another ſaying, which the ſame Auguſtine hath in his ſecond booke of the city of god, chap. 12. Where he ſaith, ſpeaking euen of good and holie men as it ſhould ſeeme: <hi>who though they be aſſured of the reward of their perſeuerance, yet are become vncertaine concerning perſeuerance it ſelfe. For vvhat man is he, that knoweth he ſhall continue in the action of vvelldoing, and proceeding in righteouſneſſe vnto the ende, vnleſſe by ſome ſpeciall or particular reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he be thereof certified from him, who in his iuſt iudgement doeth not inſtruct all men concerning this matter, and yet for all that faileth or deceiueth none.</hi> Here ſay our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Auguſtine plainely denieth, that the Saints are ſure of their perſeuerance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance euen vnto the ende. But none ſhallbe ſaued, but he that continueth vnto the ende.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2304:92"/> Auguſtine therefore denieth, that men are or can be aſſured concerning their ſaluation. To all this we aunſwer, that Auguſtine ſpeaketh here, of ſuch an vncertaintie and ignorance, as is oppoſite not vnto faith, but vnto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that is to ſaye, he ſpeaketh not here of the aſſuredneſſe of faith, concerning which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we reaſon in this place or queſtion: but of the certaintie of knowledge, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter then the certaintie of faith, and differing from it, becauſe onely the elect haue this, and manie beſides them haue that other. Signifying that wee are not ſure of perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and therefore not of ſaluation neither, to wit by the certaintie of our knowledge, and yet not denying our aſſurance of it by the certainetie of faith. And this we may perceiue euen out of Auguſtine himſelfe, and ſo make him his own beſt expoſitour. For firſt going about to prooue that which he ſaid, namely that Saints and holy men are not allwaies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of their perſeuerance, he addeth and ſaith, <hi>vvho knoweth</hi> (and not who beleeueth) <hi>vnleſſe by ſome ſpeciall reuelation he be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therof &amp;c.</hi> Sith therfore he meaneth that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2304:93"/> men are ſometimes found vncertaine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their owne perſeuerance, becauſe no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth that he ſhall perſeueare in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in righteouſneſſe, it is euident that he ment this his ſpeach, of that vncertaintie and of that ignorance, which is oppoſite to know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, and not of that which is oppoſite to faith (and differ as much one of them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as knowledge and faith doe) that is to ſay, that he affirmeth of the Saintes, that they know not, that they ſhall perſeuer in the very action and going forward of iuſtice: and not that they beleeue it not or ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, that by Gods grace through Chriſt they ſhallbe ſaued and vpheld, both to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue vnto the ende, and ſo perſeuering to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this life, yea he will rather haue men to beleeue this, for he addeth. But he wil make vs continue euen vnto the ende of our liues in himſelfe, to whome we daily ſay, <hi>lead vs not into temptation.</hi> Secondly when he ſaieth: who knoweth whether he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the action and proceeding of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, he preſently adioyneth, vnleſſe he bee by ſome reuelation certified from him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2304:93"/> &amp;c. therefore we may plainely perceiue that he meaneth ſuch a manner of knowledge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome ſpecial matter or thing to come yea ſuch a knowledge alſo as is manifeſted by reuelation, which in our daies is ceaſed &amp; we hauing now no other way wherby god hath reuealed his will then by his word: which though it ſpeake not ſo particularly and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vnto euery one as former viſions &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations did, yet doth it deliuer matter of no leſſe certainety &amp; as much to be beleued then thoſe reuelations did, as may perceiue by that of Luk. 16. <hi>They haue Moſes &amp; the Prophets if they vvill not heare them, neither will they beleeue though a man ſhould riſe againe from the dead.</hi> Thirdly the ſame Auguſtine in his booke of the good of perſeuerance, doth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſecond chapter to the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, and at large euen according to Cyprians iudgement if I be not deceiued, ſhewe, that the Saints of God do in euery petition of the Lords praier pray for the gift and grace of perſeuerance. How rightly this is gathered or done I mind not now to determine, onely from hence it appeareth, that all the true and right belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2304:94"/> fathers, and particularly Auguſtine doth teach, that ſith ſuch a grace is praied for and praier cannot proceede but from faith: for howe ſhall they call vpon him in whome they beleeue not, and from praier there muſt be abandoned al doubting, that therefore howeſoeuer they did not certainely knowe yet they did aſſuredly beleeue, that they ſhould be vphelde to perſeuer euen vnto the ende. Therefore we may ſafely ſay that Auguſtine at no hand would attribute to the Saints any vncertainty of faith touching their peiſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> did thinke that they ſhould doubt, of the grace of perſeuerance, for which they were to pray, or would haue them as vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or doubtfull perſons, to be toſſed two and fro like waues of the ſea, ſpecially as in reſpect of God and his promiſes, and other aſſured pledges that God hath giuen to ſeale vp that great mercie in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Otherwiſe we knowe that neither he nor any other man, meaſuring men in their corruptions or if you will in their owne ſtrength, did or doe hold that they could be ſtable, and ſteadfaſt in the Lords waies: and that therefore indeede they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2304:94"/> had good cauſe to be ielous or ſuſpitious, &amp; that not amiſſe, or to feare if you will as in reſpect of their owne weakneſſe. And this is that which the ſame Auguſtine openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, in the ſame booke of the good of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance, chap. 8. By all which it is plaine and euident, that when Auguſtine ſpeaketh of the vncertainty of the perſeruerance of the Saints, he vnderſtandeth it of that vncertainty which ariſeth from our ſelues, as when we conſider our weakeneſſe to good workes, &amp; pronenes to ſin, who is he that beginneth not to ſtagger and doubt; and not of that which ſpringeth from diſtruſt or doubting of the ſtrength, preſeruation, and vpholding of god: for concerning that he teacheth vs to pray continually. But they yet vrge this further &amp; ſay, that there is an antitheſis or oppoſition, betweene the reward of perſeuerance and the gift or grace of perſeuerance it ſelfe, and that therefore we muſt vnderſtand, as in the former aſſurance of faith, ſo in the latter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of faith. We anſweare neither wil we deny, but that there is an antitheſis or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yea and that it is of certainty and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certenly,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2304:95"/> but not of the meaſure of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vncertainty. For ſtill we ſtand vpon that that he meaneth it of ſuch vncertainty, as is oppoſed againſt knowledge &amp; not againſt faith, which point alſo hath beene prooued a little before, and that out of Auguſtine, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And therefore the vncertainty, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of muſt be vnderſtood diuerſly, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning the reward of perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which that it dependeth of God onely, &amp; not of any indeauour of ours, is without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: for that God ſhould render vnto them that perſeuere the reward of perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he requireth nothing of our indeauour, ſtudie, care, &amp;c. but that as God himſelfe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto them, ſo he doth aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that reward And yet becauſe to their good perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, their is required alſo their indeauour and care (which as it is in and of themſelues very infirme and doubtfull) they cannot but ſometimes ſtand in feare of the perſeuerance and holding out of this their ſtudie and care. So then he that in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can put a difference betwixt God &amp; man, and betwixt that which is from the one or
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2304:95"/> from the other: nay I will ſay more he that can diſcerne in himſelfe, betwixt that which is in and of himſelfe, and that which is from God (and by that meane alſo in ſome meaſure found in other men) ſhal be able to determine this doubt, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly they alleadge that which Ierome hath, vpon the ninth chapter of Eccleſiaſtes ſaying, <hi>I haue found that the workes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men indeede are in the hand of God, and yet that they cannot nowe know, whether they be beloued of God or no: and that they are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to and fro, whether the things which they indure, they doe indure, for triall or for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And a little after: <hi>whoſoeuer they are that ſuffer aduerſitie, it is nowe vncertaine whether they ſuffer them through the loue of God as did Iob, or through his hatred as very many ſinners doe.</hi> But to this place of Ierome we anſwere, that be ſpeaketh here not of that iudgement, which is to be giuen or gathered, out of Gods word generally: and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly out of the promiſes thereof, vpon which indeede both for the remouing of doubting, and the better aſſurance of their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2304:96"/> owne hearts Gods children doe comfortably relie and ſtay themſelues, but of that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is or may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtreſſed eſtate or afflictions of men, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Godly, from which becauſe God afflicteth or ſtriketh them: for diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry cauſes beſt knowne vnto his wiſdome: as to try their faith, to prooue their patience, to make his ſtrength to appeare and be made perfect in their weakenes, &amp;c. there can be no certaine concluſion made, or iudgement giuen. And it ſeemeth to me that he meaneth no other thing, but that which Eccleſiaſtes or the preacher himſelfe doth; namely that by the outward euent and ſucceſſe of thinges, we cannot certainely conclude or knowe touching the loue or hatred of God towards vs. This is my meaning: that he ſpeaketh not here of euery knowledge or ignorance of the loue or hatred of God: or of al the means, whereby theſe things may be manifeſted or diſcerned, but of that onely and ſimply, which is to be felt or drawne from the preſent eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or ſucceſſe of affliction or puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: which may appeare not onely by the reaſons before
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2304:96"/> alleadged, becauſe God hath ſo many endes which he aimeth at in the ſtriking of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but euen by Ieromes owne wordes if they be well weighed, or els why doth he ſo much mention, induring and ſuffering for triall or puniſhment: and alleadgeth to that end the loue of God, Iobs example &amp;c. To which we may adde this, that no doubt but Ierome knewe this trueth alſo that though there were in men euen in the beſt men mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufficient to mooue God to ſtrike or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſinne, that yet he did not alwaies do it to that ende, but that ſometime as it is ſaid of the blinde man in Iohn 9. that neither he nor his parents had ſinned, but that it was done that God might be glorified, ſo he dealeth nowe a daies. If this wil not ſatisfie, we ſay we may aunſwere further thus, namely that he ſpeaketh not of or againſt the aſſurance of faith: but of the trouble, that many times the more ſimple ſort haue in them-ſelues: by that ſame equal ſtate as in regard of outward things ſpecially that is betweene the good &amp; the bad. And this may ſufficiently enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare euen by ſuch wordes as Ierome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2304:97"/> afterward addeth, ſaying, ſuch things as of themſelues are neither good nor euill, but are called by the wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this world meane or indifferent, which fall out alike to the iuſt and vniuſt, doe much trouble all ſimple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: why they ſhould ſo fall out. By which wordes it appeareth, that Ierome did neither attribute to all the beleeuers, that ignorance of Gods loue towards them, neither that he did attribute it ſimply vnto them, to whome he doth attribute but as in reſpect though not of the perſons yet of the things: nor mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that it was in them at all times and ſeaſons, but onely in the time of triall and great affliction for thoſe indeede that doe truely beleeue in Chriſt, and that are not ceaſed with that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous temptation that fell vpon Iob and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dauid. Pſal. 37. and vpon Ieremie, Iere. 12. and is diſcribed in theſe places, concerning the outward felicitie of the wicked, and the miſeries of the godly, they both may and are wont to reioice in afflictions, as we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue both by the doctrine of the word, Rom. 5. and by the examples of it alſo Act. 14. and 16. yea euen thoſe before named Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2304:97"/> Iob, and Ieremie: and they that are or may be troubled as they were, though in and for the time of their temptation they doe it not, yet afterwards they beleeue as the reſt of Gods people, and reioyce as the reſt of the Saints, in their faith and hope.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly they bring out of Hierome, certaine words that he hath vpon the fourth chap. of Daniels prophecie, ſaying, <hi>when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell that foreknew of things to come, doubteth concerning the iudgement of god ſaying. It may be god will pardon thy ſinnes, ſurely they muſt commit a verie raſh action, that dare boldly promiſe pardon to ſinners.</hi> Wherevnto we ſay firſt that Ierome, doth not here doubt whether God will graunt pardon of ſinne, to ſuch ſinners as doe truly repent. For he knew it to be the doctrine of the word, and a free promiſe of god in the goſpell, that repentance and forgiuenes of ſinnes ſhould bee preached in the name of Chriſt his ſonne: but he iuſtly diſliketh their boldneſſe that to vnrepentant ſinners did boldly and freely promiſe pardon, not ſufficiently conſidering, whether they did truely repent yea or no: which fact or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2304:98"/> of theirs was then &amp; is now, if it ſhould be vſed, iuſtlie to bee diſliked, becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine and practiſ of God in his word, which will not haue remiſſion of ſins to be deliuered or propounded but to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and beleeuing ſinners. And this is Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms meaning, as appeareth by this, where he ſaith, <hi>they dare boldly promiſe pardon to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Beſides what if we ſhould grant, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome ſaith as much as they would haue him to ſay, muſt we becauſe he ſpeaketh vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably or vnſauourely, and indeede ſo as doth not well agree with the Scriptures, therefore embrace it. No, no, we muſt in all things, but ſpecially in the matters of our faith and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, ſtand vnto the ſentence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy Scriptures, &amp; not the words of Hierom or any other of the fathers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. And how rightly (if it ſhould bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as they would haue it) this is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Daniels wordes, either in the bare letter or in the meaning thereof, may appeare by that which hath beene ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true and naturall meaning of the place of the Prophet, that we may ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2304:98"/> of the weakeneſſe of the words in them ſelues, and of the collection that is made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for how hangeth this together? or what ſtrength is there in it? Daniell was acquainted with &amp; foreknew things that were to come, therefore he muſt alſo bee aſſured, either of the generall repentance of whole people, or of the ſound conuerſion of ſome particular perſons. Indeed if we were aſſured, that he that had receiued one grace, were indewed withall: or if that could be prooued as true &amp; ſound, or that god may not diſtribute his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as he will, to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, to none all, it were ſomewhat. But theſe things being as they are. Hieroms collection cannot be very good. But let it be as may be, wee ſay nothing to deface him, or to puffe vp our ſelues, but to ſhewe that the aduerſaries haue not, nor cannot any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of way haue ſuch hold of him or from him as they ſuppoſe. And the like may we ſay of al the reſt: whoſe authorities we ceaſe further to anſwer as we becauſe that which hath beene ſaid to theſe, will ſuffice to ſatisfie the other, as alſo becauſe we would auoid tediouſneſſe, not onely in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2304:99"/> matter vnneceſſarie, but euen alſo in that which is neceſſary, and ſo make haſt to more materiall points and matter of more weight and importance.</p>
            <p>Hitherto wee haue bin buſied and I hope not vnprofitably, in aunſwering whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer our aduerſaries haue beene able to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, either out of Scripture, or from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or fathers againſt the certainetie of faith in the fauour of God, touching our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c. or for the maintenance and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that doubtfulneſſe and diſtruſt, which they hold in themſelues, and would obtrude or thruſt vnto others. By all which it plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently appeareth, that that doctrine of theirs concerning doubting, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the word of God, or the writings of the fathers rightly vnderſtood, or is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon anie ſound or religious reaſon, and that therefore indeede, it is not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Scripture doctrine, or a doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the bookes and writinges of holie men indued with ſound and vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is taken rather, as a dreame and fantaſie of their owne which together with
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2304:99"/> with them will vaniſh awaye, they beeing ſo farre of their preiudiſing the trueth which they haue ſeemed to oppugne and impugne, that they haue rather eſtabliſhed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame, ſo true here and elſe where, euen in all reſpects muſt that be that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint Paule ſpeaketh in the ſecond to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the thirteene, where he ſaith. <hi>We cannot do any thing againſt the truth but for the trueth.</hi> Now we are in as few words as posſiblie wee can to declare, that this their doctrine of doubting, directly ſtriueth againſt gods holy word, &amp; the writings of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fathers religions reaſon and whatſoeuer elſe we can recken vp: that ſo when wee ſee, it hath not onely nothing for it, but all againſt it, wee may caſt it away with bisſing and ſo more ſoundlie cleaue and ſtick to the truth of God and his word.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This doctrine of the papiſts concerning doubting of Gods grace, our owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c. is firſt directlie contrarie to two ſorts of teſtimonies, contained in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures or writinges of God. The firſt ſort is of them, that doe manifeſtlie and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2304:100"/> &amp; plainely inſtruct vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, and the certainetie confidencie and boldnes of beleeuers, ſhewing alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that by faith and the ſound fruites thereof we may ſafelie iudge and determine, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning election, ſpecially our owne. The ſecond ſort is of them in which God himſelfe by his word and ſpirite, hath ſharpely reprooued and iuſtly condemned doubting concerning himſelfe, his goodneſſe, power, word &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes therin contained. To put downe all the particular places of both kindes in the verie words of the text would bee tedious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed vnneceſſarie, becauſe the trueth of the doctrin of the word ſtandeth not in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and conformitie of places, but vpon God, and that ſufficient credit in it ſelfe; that God hath giuen to it. Notwithſtanding wee will touch ſome, and by quotation onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the godlie and ſtudious reader, to the the reſt that we thinke meet for this purpoſe and to his continuall reading of the word, by which we may doubtleſſe add many more of the like nature. In the epiſtle to the Hebreues, there are two worthy places. The 1. is chap.

Yet that glorie of his ſhould not hinder vs from approching vnto him, but rather further vs indeed, not onely becauſe he hath the fulnes of all power in his hand, as v. 14. but alſo becauſe he is our eldeſt brother, and is not onely ſenſibly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the feeling of out infirmities and miſeries but accounteth them all euen as his owne, and therefore wee may come with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The 2. place is chap. 10. ver. 22. where he ſaith: <hi>Let vs draw neere with a true heart, in aſſurance of faith our harts being pure from an euill conſcience.</hi> It is an exhortation as the former, &amp; drawne indeed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the maieſtie &amp; dignitie of Chriſts prieſthood, ſet out and deſcribed verſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

Euen ſo they that are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this wordly life and hang vpon the arme of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue alwaies wauering &amp; doubt ful mindes, ſwaying ſome times this way &amp; ſometimes that way, neither they themſelues nor other men knowing what will become of them, or which way they will fall. In the 14. of Matthew though Peter had done well and in ſtrength of faith had walked a while vpon the water, and Chriſt had ſtretched forth his hand and caught him, &amp; ſaued him from ſinking, yet he ſaith vnto him, <hi>O thou of little faith vvherefore dideſt thou doubt?</hi> which if doubting had not beene euill he would not haue done: or had it beene a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue he could not haue done, for ſo he ſhould either haue iuſtified that which is corrupt, or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2304:103"/> condemned that which is good, and Chriſt was as free from all other ſinne, ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that. He that will ſee more let him read Math. 6.30. Rom. 14.23. Hebr. 12. verſe 12.13. and ſpecially of Rom. 14. where he ſaith, <hi>what ſoeuer is not of faith</hi> (that is to ſay a grounded perſwaſion out of the word; but is done the conſcience doubting of it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning againſt it (<hi>is ſinne.</hi> And good reaſon there is it ſhould be ſo: for faith and truſt in God, his word and promiſes is contrary to doubting and diſtruſtfulneſſe: and if faith be a vertue, then doubting is a vice: and therefore faith and truſt beeing once eſtabliſhed, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which is contrary or oppoſite vnto it is remoued. But though this trueth be as cleare as the Sunne, yet our adverſaries put ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ception againſt it, as firſt thus the faithfull or Godly haue alwaies doubting in them, or cleauing vnto them. What and if we graunt that they haue the ſeed of this ſinne as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dwelling within them, is it therefore good? or muſt it be foſtered and fooded. So a man might ſay they haue the reliques and remainders of other tranſgresſions in them,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2304:103"/> therefore they are good, or they muſt not be ſtriuen againſt. This were indeed to let men liue as they liſt, and when they haue done ſoddenly to goe downe into the graue. For the obiection it ſelfe it ſelfe it is not true, that the faithfull haue alwaies doubting in them, as we may perceiue by the hope of their hearts, their prayers to God, and other duties of obedience to God and ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they could not forme at any time if they had at al times doubting in them. That the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doe ſometimes doubt, I doubt not How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit if they could tell from whence it came, the queſtion would be cleared. It ſpringeth from the corruption of nature, and from a heart that without reſpect of Gods mercy &amp; promiſes is ceaſed with the ſenſe of ſinne and apprehenſion of Gods iudgement againſt them for the ſame, which though it may be many times in the wicked but without fruit: yet is it more rife euen in the godly, who are this way more liuely and powerfully affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This doubting is not faith, neither indeed doth it flow from faith, neither is it of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or nature of faith, but commeth from
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2304:104"/> our weakeneſſe as before hath beene ſaid, &amp; fighteth againſt faith, though it be true in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat and conflict faith doth ouercome and get the victorie at the laſt: as we may perceiue Mark. 9. where it is ſaid by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the poſſeſſed child <hi>I beleeue Lord help my vnbeleefe.</hi> For in this queſtion we ſpeake not of ſuch an imagination or conceit of faith as during the infirmitie or weakneſſe of our fleſh, hath by reaſon of the remainders of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no doubting at al adioyned with it in the perſon that hath receiued that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gift of faith: but we mean it of ſuch a faith as ſteſtdfaſtly though weakely laieth hold aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly of the obiect of it. For we knowe and confeſſe that faith as it is Gods worke, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and abſolute: and yet as it is in vs, to be imperfect, and to haue as we may ſay his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and increaſings. And yet we feele and perceiue that this faith though neuer ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, then, when it laieth hold, of the true and onely obiect of it, namely Chriſt our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour and his merites: is true and ſound, and from the obiect; which our faith though it be weake laieth hould of, we haue much
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2304:104"/> firme and aſſured comfort. And if this were not true, we could not comfort our ſelues, neither in our knowledge, patience, prayer, or any othergood worke beſide, becauſe we knowe in part, we propheſie in part &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>condly ſome except further &amp; ſay, that Paul and the Apoſtles in the places aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpeake of that certainty of their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which they had by ſpeciall reuelation and not that they affirme, that all the faithfull haue the like aſſurance. But the aunſwere is eaſy. The Apoſtles doe or did not ſpeake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of themſelues, but of all the faithfull: and not of their owne faith and ſaluation only, but of the common faith and ſaluation of all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Which as it may appeare by this, be cauſe faith and ſaluation are common graces, ſo by this becauſe they vſe the wordes of the plurall number, and ſuch as doe indifferently comprehend all the faithfull, yea by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaches alſo which they vſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the matter it ſelfe, namely ſpeaking inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly of faith. And in all of them they make this the foundation of our aſſurance and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that Chriſt is our Mediatour, that he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2304:105"/> died for vs &amp;c. Beſides Rom. 4. he ſpeaketh concerning Abrahams faith, and ſheweth that <hi>it was written before for our ſakes, and equally belonged vnto all the faithfull.</hi> So that we may ſee, they ſpeake of no propper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning themſelues: nor in theſe places alleadged and quoted, if any ſpeciall reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning their owne ſaluation, but of a grace common to all the elect of God: &amp; ther fore this exception is but a meere cauill.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly this their doctrine of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſtandeth vp againſt the word and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs yea inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs for the glory of Gods name and our owne good to repent and beleeue the goſpel. As Marke 11. verſe. 15. <hi>Repent and beleeue the Goſpell:</hi> as alſo againſt thoſe ſweete exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are giuen vs in the ſame worde: to prouoke to confidence and religious boldnes as that of Hebrewes 4.16. <hi>Let vs therefore goe boldly vnto the throne of grace that vve may receiue mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede:</hi> and that of Hebr. 10.22. <hi>Let vs drawe neere, vvith a true heart in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith &amp;c.</hi> And ſundry ſuch like as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2304:105"/> as theſe. For firſt looke whatſoeuer god en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth or commandeth, it is neither doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be imbraced, as in regard of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion becauſe that will breed neglect at the leaſt if not contempt of him and his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that commaundeth, yea indeed alſo of the thing it ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded: nor to be ſluggiſhlie or ſlouthfully performed, as in regard of our practiſe, becauſe as god in euerie thing loueth chearefulneſſe, ſo likewiſe in the obedience of his law: much leſſe may it be deferred and put of, both becauſe time is not our owne, &amp; we haue no charter or warrant of our liues, no not for one minute of an houre. Beſides who knoweth not that theſe thinges are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite one of them to another, namely for God to commaund vs, and for vs either to doubt of himſelfe or the thing or things that he preſcribeth. For if he be God, he muſt be beleeued, as well in the things he enioyneth for his worſhip and our obedience, as in the promiſes he propoundeth, for the expresſing of the manifold riches of his grace, &amp; offring ſtrong conſolation to our diſtreſſed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecnes, otherwiſe if wee doubt him or diſtruſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2304:106"/> him therein, we robbe him of his glorie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine wee may reaſon for the better confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this point, from the true meaning of theſe words, <hi>beleeue the goſpell.</hi> To <hi>beleeue the goſpell,</hi> I take to be nothing elſe, but to be rightly perſwaded of and particularly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto our owne hearts, thoſe promiſes which are made vnto vs in the Goſpell, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe that concerne the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes here in this life, and our euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the life to come. But this is not to doubt, but certainelie to be aſſured and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded rather that the whole goſpell is true, and particularly this part of it, that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the Sauiour of all them that beleeue in him, for faith and repentance muſt be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in his name: and there is no other name giuen vnder heauen wherein men muſt bee ſaued but his: and therefore they that hold or teach otherwiſe, doe not onely not knowe what it is to beleeue, but euacuat and deſtroy faith, the goſpell Chriſt Ieſus and al. Sith ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that do truly beleeue, do not doubt concerning that which they doe beleeue, (I meane for the time, manner and meaſure of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2304:106"/> their faith: for I am not ignorant of this that that which is ſtrong at one time, as in regard of gods grace and ſpirite ſupporting vs, may be infirme and weake at another, as in regard of the remainders of our ſinnes, and the dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſlowneſſe of our hearts to beleeue) it will well, yea and muſt of necesſitie follow that all they that doe truely beleeue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, ought not at any hand to doubt or diſtruſt concerning gods goodneſſe, the infinite merite of Chriſts obedience, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their ſinnes, or the ſauing of their ſoules: the reaſon is becauſe doubting here &amp; that faith that God hath wrought in them, cannot ſtand together. And as for the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vſed in the word we may ſay as much, namely that God meaneth thereby to ſtirre vs vp ſtedfaſtly and without wauering to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon him: or elſe he would neuer haue ſo earneſtly called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs therfore or prouoked vs thereto, vnleſſe he had meant as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as he vrgeth or ſtirreth vs vp in words. It is for men that are corrupted to dallie and to diſſemble ſo, and to make ſhew in words of more then they meane indeed, a fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2304:107"/> as heretofore ſo nowe adaies in all ſtates and degrees, yea euen in them that for their places and callings approch moſt neere vnto God, but no ſuch thing hath beene or euer ſhall be found in the holy one of Iſraell: for as he is not man but God, and therefore iudgeth not according vnto man, or hath reſpect of perſon, ſo he cannot lie or diſſemble, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogeather good and holy himſelfe, and deliuering as we may, the teſtimonies and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his loue towards vs, meaneth as he ſpeaketh ſo ſhall all fleſh finde it: whether it be in the faithfull promiſes concerning peace and life, or the execution of his iudgements in this world or that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Thirdly this doctrine of doubting fighteth againſt certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty &amp; aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al ſuch promiſes as god hath graciouſly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs ſpecially thoſe that he hath made vnto vs for the forgiuenes of our ſins, &amp; our eternall ſaluation through Chriſt. Of which ſort is that of Iſay 1.17. <hi>Though your ſinnes were as crimſin they ſhall be made white as ſnowe, though they were red as ſcarlet, they ſhalbe as wooll:</hi> and that of Ioh. 3.16. <hi>So God loued the world that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2304:107"/> hit onely begotten ſonne, that who ſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh but haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life.</hi> 1. Cor. 130. <hi>Chriſt is made of God vnto vs, vviſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and redemption,</hi> and ſundry others. Nowe the promiſes of God and mans, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, concerning the truth and certenty ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: VVhether we reſpect the things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or Gods good will and power that hath promiſed, they are not onely oppoſite or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one of them to another: but indeede o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe or deſtroy one an other. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promiſe yea though it be but a promiſe of the lawe, requireth faith in it or to it, much more a promiſe of the Goſpell, calleth for faith, whether the promiſe be made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, or the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of our ſoules, or concerning any other grace whatſoeuer, and approoueth not of doubting at any hand: the reaſon whereof is plaine, becauſe Gods promiſe manifeſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in his word, and the faith that he hath wrought in our hearts by his word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not our naturall doubting &amp; diſtruſt, they are relatiues that is to ſay, ſuch things as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2304:108"/> one preſuppoſeth another, namely that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, implieth faith, or els the promiſe is of no force as in regard of men, and faith impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a promiſe, as the proper and peculier obiect of it, or els it cannot be counted faith. And ſith the promiſe indeed cannot otherwiſe be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeene, but by the eye of faith, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and laid hold of, but by the hand of faith, which point the Apoſtle ſheweth, Ro. 4. when he ſaith <hi>therefore it is by faith, that it might come by grace &amp; the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeede &amp;c.</hi> it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe: that faith as Gods worke in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Gods promiſes as from himſelfe &amp; not doubting or diſtruſt are relatiues as we call them. And good reaſon both for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and negation for ſuch as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are, ſuch muſt the inſtrument be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the ſame: but the promiſes are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and from God, and ſo is faith in vs: and not doubting for that is from the corruption of our owne nature which hath no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God or goodneſſe, till it be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and changed from aboue. And therefore we may ſafely conclud and ſay, eſtabliſh gods
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2304:108"/> promiſe, or faith is eſtabliſhed: and put doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on, Gods promiſe is euacuated: for ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it of faith, as was ſaid before out of Rom. 4. <hi>that the promiſe might be ſure.</hi> then if it be not of faith but of doubting, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is not firme or ſure, to wit, to vs, though as in regard of it ſelfe, and God the giuer of it, it is alwaies certaine. And this is that alſo which I thinke Saint Iohn meaneth when he ſaith, <hi>he that beleeueth not God as he hath reuealed him ſelfe in his worde, and ſpecially in his promiſes: hath made him a lier: becauſe he beleeueth not the record, that God witneſſed of that his ſonne.</hi> But againſt this our popiſh aduerſaries put many exceptions: as firſt they ſay, that men muſt doubt not as in reſpect of Gods promiſes, but as in regard of their own indignity or vnworthineſſe, becauſe we are worthy to obtaine or haue that which God hath promiſed. For it may ſo fall out, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man hath failed in the conditions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to Gods promiſes, he may rightly doubt whether he ſhall haue that which god hath promiſed: that is to ſay men ſhould not doubt whether God will faile in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2304:109"/> of his graces and promiſes made vnto vs, but leſt we performe not the conditions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned thereto, becauſe god hath not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eternall life, nor any thing elſe but vnder condition: or elſe they meane that doubting is not to be referred to gods promiſes but to our defects and the impediments of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, leaſt happily we want the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the conditions ioyned with Gods promiſes. This is their exception, but we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that both their affirmation, in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and their explanation of it alſo, (for of theſe two parts doeth it conſiſt) are ſtarke nought, for whatſoeuer they ſay, or howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they interpret their owne ſpeaches, yet if they enioyne and teach men to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God for Chriſts ſake, will be mercifull to ſuch as beleeue in him, they appointe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them to doubt of the grace of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods grace, Chriſts merits, mans faith, being gods worke in vs, are not nor cannot be diſioyned, which they are if men doubt or do teach others to doubt of all or of any of them, ſpecially if that doctrine of doubting be receiued. But wee will more particularly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2304:109"/> looke into the wordes and matter of this exception. They tell vs that we ſhould not doubt as in reſpect of Gods promiſes: &amp; who would doubt of that or thinke or ſay ſo, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he were ſome notable Atheiſt or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, who for his thoughts but wordes eſpecially ſhould rather haue his tongue pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of his head, and be iuſtly executed by death, then be ſuffered to liue amongſt men. But that we ſhould doubt of our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, becauſe we are vnworthie to obtaine or to haue accompliſhed Gods promiſes vnto vs, that we are indeed vtterly and altogether vnworthy of all or any good thing from god no godly man I thinke wil deny: nay and if it will pleaſure our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, we will graunt them more then that, namely that we are worthy of all puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both temporall and eternall, in body and ſoule. Howebeit this will not followe, that becauſe we are vnworthy of the graces, god ſhould not beſtowe his mercies and graces where as pleaſeth him, or this that therefore we ſhould not doubt or diſtruſt God and his mercies. For this is no vſe of our own vnwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thineſſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2304:110"/> either in the ſight or ſenſe of it, to make vs to call into queſtion or to contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the trueth of gods promiſes nay rather if there be any vſe of it that way, ouer and beſides the vnfained humiliation of vs at the feet of god, it ſerueth rather to inſtruct and teach vs that which the Apoſtle doth deliuer in his epiſtle to the Romanes, that <hi>where ſine hath abounded there grace hath abounded much more.</hi> Yea we ſay further concerning this point of our vnworthineſſe, that we ſhould not therefore doubt of gods fauour or the forgiuneſſe of ſinnes: the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the trueth and cerenty of gods promiſe dependeth not vpon our owne worthineſſe ot vnworthineſſe for that were to ſubiect vnto man, but on the power, fidelity, and free fauour of god towards vs: neither is it confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto vs becauſe we are worthy of it, or made voide and of no effect becauſe we are vnworthy, for that ſhall neuer be found true both in mercy and iudgement that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, If we beleeue not: yet abideth he faithfull, he cannot deny himſelfe: but therfore was the promiſe both giuen and publiſhed, &amp;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2304:110"/> therefore is Chriſt alſo become our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, becauſe we are vnworthy, and that the father for his ſake, might become mercifull &amp; gratious vnto vs, according to which it is ſaid, Rom. 8. <hi>Now then there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus &amp;c.</hi> Whereas had not our vnworthineſſe beene neither had gods grace ſo plainly and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appeared, neither indeede could Chriſt haue become our interceſſor or Mediatour. And therefore our vnworthineſſe ſhould bee ſoe farre off to worke in vs any doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of gods goodneſſe, Chriſts merits, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer as in regard of our ſelues it may iuſtly humble vs and hold vs from preſumption, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of deſert &amp;c. that it ſhould rather make vs make ſpeed thereto, &amp; to labour the ſteed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt apprehenſion thereof: and indeed we are to ſet againſt the greatneſſe of our vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the infinite bounty of god in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: which god would haue vs, as we may perceiue by by his commanding of vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, to giue free and full conſent vnto. As for the conditions they ſpeake of we tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are adioyned to the promiſes, not as to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2304:111"/> make the promiſes more ſtrong in themſelus or as in reſpect of God, for ſo they are alwaies ſure and certain, but the better to ſeale vp the faithfull performance of them in our hearts, while wee are inabled by God in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to accompliſh &amp; performe the ſame, we aſſuring our owne hearts that ſith we cannot perfectly fulfill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſelues, &amp; yet being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by another for vs, we ſhal in his abſolute accompliſhment therof &amp; righteouſnes, haue a plentifull ſupply for all our defects whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, we knowing further, that if many a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pasſionate man in the world, doe not take all aduantages of breach of couenants or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that another hath made with him, God who is compasſion it ſelfe, will not deale ſo with his ſeruantes, whome he hath ſingled out vnto himſelfe, and ſeparated to eternall life, notwithſtanding their weakeneſſe and wants. And conditions in this caſe God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth none vnto vs by the Goſpell, but to repent and beleeue the goſpel, both which are wrought in vs in ſome meaſure, by his owne hand and grace, and therfore we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelues, that being his owne work, he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2304:111"/> wil not reiect it, but accept it rather notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our weakeneſſes and wants by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the remainders of our corruption ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned thereto. As for the explanation or expoſition following, it hath receiued a full aunſwere before, and therfore we let it paſſe, and come to a ſecond exception, that they make againſt this trueth thus. We are not ſure ſay they, whether we performe theſe conditions, that is whether we ſufficiently repent vs of our ſinnes, or doe ſufficiently beleeue the promiſes of God, and therefore that wee are not aſſured concerning Gods promiſes. But this we aunſwere is the ſame poyſon, that hath beene propounded in ſome of their arguments before put downe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, whether we might remit the reader. How be it in a word or two, we will ſaye ſomewhat. And firſt we giue them to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that their conſequent were good &amp; and forcible if they had prooued or could prooue, that the trueth &amp; cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inetie of gods holy and heauenly promiſes did depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſufficiencie of our faith &amp; repentance, but that being not prooued is of no importance.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2304:112"/> Nay we ſay further that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be prooued becauſe God in his word hath not preſcribed a limited and determined meaſure of faith and repentance: which whoſoeuer hath not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto, he cannot be certified or aſſured of gods grace and his owne ſaluation, but therin onely requireth at our hands faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, both which graces as all other fruits of the ſpirite, are in ſome more, and in ſome leſſe according to the meaſure thereof giuen vnto men from God. And this may appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt ſimply and plainely ſaith: <hi>He that beleeueth in me hath euerlaſting life,</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſing how much or how litle faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to that worke, ſo it be ſound and true. And we are taught in the Scriptures to pray for augmentation and increaſe of faith, and to vſe all good meanes, whereby we may bee builded vp therein, and ſo proceed from faith to faith &amp;c. So may we; yea ſo ought wee to pray for increaſe of repentance &amp; other fruits &amp; of graces of the ſpirit, and yet when we haue attained through Gods goodneſſe towards vs, a good meaſure, yet wee ſhall haue our lacks. And what can be more plaine, then that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2304:112"/> Chriſt ſaith to the woman Luke 7. <hi>thy ſaith hath ſaued thee,</hi> although wee doubt not the place and circumſtances of it conſidered to affirme, that ſhe had not ſufficient either faith or repentance. And therefore we may ſafely conclude, that though we beleeue weakelie yet ſo it be truely and rightly al our ſinnes are forgiuen vs for Ieſus Chriſt ſake, &amp; we made partakers of all the fruites and merits of his death, and pasſion. Beſids what an abſurditie will follow this conceit of ſufficiencie of faith and repentance, for ſith no man liuing, can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficiently bee ſorrowfull for his ſinnes, or make any anſwer or ſatisfaction vnto god for them, or ſurely determine concerning the ſufficiencie of his faith and repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath reuealed no ſuch thing in his word, and to fetch it from his owne head or heart, will not be fit, for that is deepe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull aboue all things, it will follow: that no man ſhould hope for ſaluation, but rather deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of it: which beſides that it is abſurde, is both ungodly and vncomfortable alſo. But if they will yet further obiect and ſay, that no man knoweth whether he doth truly repent
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2304:113"/> and beleeue, or els whether he aſcribe vnto himſelfe the things he hath not. We anſwer that it is an vntrue aſſertion to ſay, that no man can tell whether he doe truely repent, beleeue, &amp;c. For though the ſcripture haue not taught vs, to knowe whether our faith is ſufficient, or our repentance weighty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet hath it giuen vs certaine infallible notes, by which we may diſcerne and iudge of the ſinceritie and trueth both of our faith and repentance. For as alll the fruites of our faith generally, are ſure ſeales and pledges of the trueth that is in vs, and more particularly our holy prayers to God, according to that which is ſaid, Rom. 10. <hi>How ſhall they call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in whome they beleeue not:</hi> ſo in the fruits and effects following our repentance ſeales vp alſo the ſinceritie and ſoundneſſe thereof, in our ſeuerall ſoules. Nowe what theſe are we may ſee largely recited. 2. Cor. 7. <hi>as great care clearing of our ſelues, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation feare, deſire, zeale, reuenge, &amp;c.</hi> And why ſhould we not or may we not ſay, that if in the little light of nature, that remaineth in vs vntainted, we may be able to diſcerne of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2304:113"/> ſome ſinnes, we may by the light of the word and ſpirit, beginning and aduauncing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, be able in ſome meaſure, to iudge of our owne faith repentance &amp;c. That a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing man may know that he doth beleeue, the Apoſtle me thinketh doth plainely ſhewe it in his own example, when he ſaith. 2. Tim. 1.2. <hi>I know whom I haue beleeued.</hi> And when Philip Act. 8. ſaid vnto the Eunuch, <hi>if thou doeſt beleeue with all thy heart &amp;c.</hi> and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>I beleeue that that Ieſus Chriſt, is that ſonne of God:</hi> did not the Eunuch both know and feele faith. The Apoſtle telleth vs. Rom. 10. <hi>that with the heart wee beleeue to iuſtification, and with the mouth make confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſaluation.</hi> And 2. Cor. 13. why doth the Apoſtle commaund or exhort, <hi>to trye our ſelues whether we be in the faith.</hi> Surely he would not haue enioyned or prouoked men to this duetie, vnleſſe they might through the power and grace of the holie ghoſt, in ſome meaſure and manner certainely know it. And 1. Cor. 2. he ſaith: <hi>we haue receiued not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the world, but the ſpirite of God.</hi> For which purpoſe alſo ſee. Epheſ. 1.17.18. and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2304:114"/> 3.16. &amp;c. and 1. Ioh. 4.15. &amp; ſundry other, from all which we may conclude, that true faith knoweth it ſelfe, and doubteth not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ſaluation, which it apprehendeth or laieth hold of. Although we denie not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that the fleſh many times intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth that which is in and of it ſelfe, that is to ſay doubting, concerning the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God. Yea our faith in Chriſt, though it be neuer ſo ſmale, yet if it be true, both hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faſt this certainetie concerning Gods grace, and our owne eternall ſaluation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo knoweth and feeleth that according to the meaſure of mercie from God, it holdeth the ſame faſt. And yet we are not ignorant of this neither, that manie times it is very infirme &amp; weak, then eſpecially when manie ſore doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, do toſſe and turmoile, yea make wearie our faint minds; which doubtings indeed are not from faith, neither of the nature of faith, but flow from the fleſh, of our old Adam in vs, which point if we know well, we ſhallbe made able, the better and more eaſily to cleare and voide this point. But yet they perſiſt and ſay, that Epicures and prophane men, euen in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2304:114"/> the midſt of their iniquities may ſuppoſe that they haue ſuch a perſwaſion of certainetie &amp; aſſurance. But we tell them firſt, that our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of true faith, and of them that do indeed beleeue, and not of epicures and prophane perſons, or of a dead faith, which many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; yea diuels may haue, as S. Iames plainly ſheweth: and that therefore they do euill and miſſe the mark, when they compare not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuerſe, but contrarie both men and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together. Secondly that we are hartilye ſorie for their blindneſſe and ignorance, that cannot as yet make a difference, betweene the imaginations and conceits of the wicked, which commonly breed and bring forth in them ſenſeleſſe and careleſneſſe, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of the godly, which as they worke comfort for the ſinnes already paſt: ſo do they breed care of conuerſation for that which is to come. Thirdly we ſay, that howſoeuer the world may fantaſie and imagine ſome ſuch matter, yet they cannot feele it, or be indeede throughly perſwaded of it, not onely becauſe God ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, who are like the raging ſea that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2304:115"/> can not reſt: whoſe vvaters caſt vp mire and dirt, but alſo becauſe wanting faith, without which alſo it is impoſſible to pleaſe god, they muſt lack this effect of it, euen the quiet fruite of righteouſneſſe, and a good conſcience before God and men.</hi> But let vs proceed to ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceptions they make againſt this truth. Some of them ſay, that is not preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed which is promiſed, therefore from this that God hath promiſed vs ſaluation, it will not follow, that wee preſently laye hold thereon: and therefore we cannot from the promiſe that is made vnto vs concerning our ſaluation, conclude that we ought to bee ſure concerning it, as if it were already accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and performed. There are many things to be ſaid to this exception or obiection. We denie not this, that God doth not alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently performe the things he hath promiſed, but that this ſhould be inferred, that therefore we ſhould doubt of the accompliſhment of them, in that time that god hath ſet with him ſelfe from before all times, is neither ſauourie in it ſelfe, nor will follow from the antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. I will put one caſe that ſhall make it as plaine
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2304:115"/> as posſibly can be. Our Sauiour Chriſt was promiſed to our firſt parents preſently after the fal, to be the perſon by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e God would reconcile the world vnto himſelf. And yet he was not manifeſted in the fleſh many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of yeares after. What ſhould they then, or thoſe that did ſucceede them after haue doubted of the accompliſhment of this moſt ſweet &amp; comfortable promiſe, becauſe it was not preſently performed. Away with ſuch wickednes I would faine ſee a reaſon for this, why wee ſhould not as well doubt of that which is paſt, ſo many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred or thouſand of yeares if you will, becauſe it is not preſently performed, or we behold it not with our eies or haue the reſt of our ſenſes ſatisfied therin: as doubt of that which in the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of gods promiſe, is to be performed in time becauſe it is not preſently done: &amp; why may not a man as ſafely infer, euen by the contrary and that alſo as in reſpect of the godly, that if they wil haue them to doubt of the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of gods promiſes, becauſe they ar differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they muſt not feare but tremble, with the diuel &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, as in regard of the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2304:116"/> vengeance that is for to come. Nay I will ſay more, if this be right that they propound as in regard of the faithfull, that they ſhould doubt becauſe it is not by and by performed, that is promiſed, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked need not feare or doubt, as in reſpect of the wrath that is threatned, becauſe it is delaied: for of contrary things, there is the contrary reaſon or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and we know that to be true, which the holy ghoſt ſpeaketh in the booke of the preacher: <hi>Though a ſinner doe euill a hundreth times, and God prolong his daies, yet I know it ſhallbe well with them that feare the Lord, and do reuerence before him: but it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his daies but ſhallbe like a ſhaddowe, becauſe he feareth not before God.</hi> Me thinketh rather this would follow: God manie times for cauſes &amp; reaſons beſt knowne vnto himſelfe, differreth the performance of his promiſes and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his wrath, therefore they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelie come, becauſe he is no changling. Can we ſay in reaſon that which is differred is not taken away? and can we not much more ſaye in chriſtian religion (wherein this is taught
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2304:116"/> vs to be the nature of faith and hope, not ſo much to regard things preſent, as thoſe that are to come, for faith that is ſeene is no faith, and therefore is here commended Hebre. 11. <hi>that being warned of God concerning thinges which were as yet not ſeene, and mooued with the reuerence he prepared the arke to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his houſhold</hi>) affirme the ſame? wee haue a by word amongſt vs that were it not for hope the heart would breake: Let vs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour herein according to trueth and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, able with patience and comfort to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vs, euen vnto the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to end all our miſeries, and to make perfect our felicitie and ioy. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be this is certaine, that whatſoeuer god promiſeth vnto his people, he doeth aſſuredly and without fayling accompliſh and perform the ſame vnto them, though happily not ſo ſoone as the word hath paſſed him, for ſo it might be they would make no great account of the fauour promiſed and performed: how be it in that time that he had appointed with himſelfe from before all times, and which he ſeeth to be moſt fit for his glorie, &amp; the good
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2304:117"/> of them that belong vnto him. For we know and beleeue him to bee both willing and true in his word that he will, and almigtie in his power that he can performe the good things promiſed, for the Lords hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſaue, neither is his eare heauy that it cannot heare. Iſay. 59. And is there not reaſon, we ſhould depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure power and prouidence, for the time to performe his promiſe, in as for the grace and goodneſſe promiſed? Surely there is, for as all things are free in God, and nothing drawne from him by conſtraint: ſo ſith he ſeeth and knoweth, what and when and where, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs then we our ſelues vnleſſe wee will be ouer ſaucie &amp; malepert with the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we muſt needs in this reſpect alſo depend vpon him. To make this plaine by one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the forgiuenes of ſinnes is promiſed and in ſome meaſure performed in this life, but the full fruition of that grace in all the partes and peeces of it, and the fruits following of it, is reſerued for the worlde or life to come. Howbeit he performeth it here eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſoone as we beginne to beleeue as appeareth Rom.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2304:117"/> 1. But he will giue vs perfect righteoſneſſe, &amp; eternall ſaluation: when the time fit for it ſhal be, for nowe we are ſaued by hope. Romans 8. and 1. Iohn 3. <hi>Now are we the ſonnes of god but yet it is not manifeſted what we ſhall be. and we knowe that when he is manifeſted we ſhallbe like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> But inough againſt theſe exceptions, let vs come to and proceede in the recitall of other abſurdities that inſue vpon this doctrine of doubting, which our aduerſaries would ſo ſtiffely defend.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly this doctrine of doubting ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally concerning al Gods fauour, and more particularly concerning the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes doth directly thwart and croſſe thoſe praiers that Gods people make and powre forth before God, and that according to his will for the comfortable feeling and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured attainment of that ſingular grace. Firſt Chriſts commandement ſaying, After this manner pray ye, and amongſt vs the reſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to ſay, forgiue vs our debts, treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or ſinnes, ſheweth vs what we ſhould do to which if we adioyne the practiſe of Gods
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2304:118"/> people, we ſhall yet more and more ſee our ſelues led thereto. Dauid a man approued of God, Pſal. 32. ſaith. <hi>Therfore</hi> or for this thing <hi>that is to ſay becauſe thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery manner of way to be ſuch a one to me &amp; ſpecially in the forgiueneſſe of my ſinnes: ſhall euery one that is godly make his praier vnto thee,</hi> that is performe praier and other obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And the wordes of the Publicane Luk. 18. ſhewe the ſame <hi>O God be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi> Now as in all things that God hath promiſed vs, and at all times, confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and aſſured hope, is moſt neceſſary ſo in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſpecially, and the rather becauſe therein we doe not onely deale with God aloofe or a far of as we ſay, but in many particularities. And God we knowe hath commanded not onely that we ſhould pray vnto him: but alſo hath forbidden vs, in out prayers, or while we are calling vpon him to doubt either of him that hath the fulneſſe of power &amp; good will in him, for his owne glory and for our good, or els receiuing the things that we ſhal aſke according to his word. Therefor Iames 1. it is ſaid, If any lacke wiſdome, let him aſke
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2304:118"/> of God, which giueth to all men liberally, and reprocheth no man: but let him aske in faith and wauer not, for he that wauereth, is like a waue of the ſea, toſt of the winde, and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, neither let him thinke that he ſhall receiue any thing of the Lord. And to the ſame intendeth 1. Ioh. where he ſaith, &amp; this is that aſſurance which we haue in him, that if we aske any thing according to his will he heareth vs. And if we know that he heareth vs whatſoeuer we aske, we knowe that we haue the petitions that we haue deſired of him, the faithfull and godly people therefore ought to beleeue and not doubt, both that their ſinnes are forgiuen them before God for Chriſts ſake in whome they beleeue, and that they may ſafely pray for the ſame in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red confidence that faith they aske nothing, but in the faith of Gods word and promiſe, they ſhall not be ſent away emptie handed.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This doctrine alſo thwarteth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the word, which propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth Chriſt vnto vs as our Mediatour and interceſſour, as 1. Tim. verſe 15. <hi>This is a true ſaying, and by al means worthy to be receiued, that Chriſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2304:119"/> Ieſus came into the worde to ſaue ſinners.</hi> And againe in the ſecond chapter of the ſame epiſtle. <hi>There is but one God and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betweene God and man: which is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And Romanes 8. <hi>It is Chriſt which is dead or rather which is riſen again, who is alſo at the right hand of god, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth requeſt for vs.</hi> And if any man liſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any more places let him ſee Heb. 7. ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially verſe 24.25.26. &amp;c. as alſo Heb. 9. verſe 24.25. And ſundry ſuch other places. For wherefore was he borne in to the world, wherefore did he liue vpon the earth? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he preach amongſt men, and worke maruailes and miracles infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>henſible? why did he die and riſe againe the third day according to the ſcriptures? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he aſcended vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? &amp; why ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh he at the right hand of God to make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall intercesſion for vs? but by remoouing of the doubtfulneſſe and diſtruſtfulneſſe, that we haue in our ſelues, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our ſinnes: and the high and heynous iniquities that we doe commit, he might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto vs ſtrong hope and aſſured com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2304:119"/> For this we muſt make reckoning of, that either, we beleeue &amp; ſo are vnder hope of grace and ſaluation: or els we beleeue not, &amp; ſo are vnder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, becauſe as our ſauiour Chriſt, ſaith he that beleeueth not is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned already: for there is no meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two. Now if we would beleeue our aduerſaries doctrine, then all theſe things in and by Chriſt muſt be done in vaine, or cauſleſly, for ſurely he that remaineth in doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting cannot aſſure his heart that the ſonne of God is become his Mediatour, and therefore alſo cannot yeeld him his due honour. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>hovve ſhall they call vpon him in whome they beleeue not?</hi> So may we ſay, how ſhal they truſt him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hearts are full of vnbeleefe, diſtruſt or doubting.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Againe the ſcripture euery where deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vnto vs doctrine, concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort of the godly and the peace of conſcience that the faithful finde in them, after they haue felt the remisſion and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. And therefore Iſaie 4. the miniſters of God are charged, <hi>to comfort yea to comfort againe and againe the people of God, and to ſpeake to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2304:120"/> the heart of Ieruſalem and to crie vnto hir that hir warfare is accompliſhed, and that hir iniquitie is pardoned &amp;c</hi> i And therefore alſo Chriſt himſelfe moſt comfortably ſaith to him that was ſicke of the palſie, <hi>Sonne be of good comfort thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> Math. 9. See further for this purpoſe alſo, Luk 7.50. Rom. 8.15. 2. Tim. 1.7. 1. Ioh. 4.18. and many other places beſides. But this doctrine of our aduerſaries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning doubting doth if it be receiued quite and cleane ſupplant the conſolation that God hath provided for vs there: as we may gather by the effects, for where there is doubting concerning Gods grace, the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, the hope of euerlaſting life &amp;c. There cannot be peace and quietneſſe of conſcience, or any ſure ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and firme comfort, but terrours and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, not onely touching their owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate, but ſpecially alſo for that which it comes, yea at the length deſperation, for that doubtfulneſſe of heart dwelt and continued entring forth at the laſt, becauſe as there is in the godly, through the fauour and loue of God towards the in Ieſus Chriſt, an increaſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2304:120"/> &amp; proceeding from faith to faith: ſo is there in the wicked by reaſon of their owne ſinne and Satans malice againſt them, a proceeding from one iniquity to another, they growing in naughtineſſe as they doe in yeares. On the other ſide where there is hope and confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce concerning Gods free fauour and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of our ſinnes, and eternall life &amp;c. there cannot be but ioy and gladneſſe; in the minde in the mouth, yea the whole man is &amp; ſhalbe affected therewith: for it is imposſible that theſe graces felt, ſhould lie long hid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſhes of our corruption, becauſe that being from God who is ſtronger then all, they will prevaile: and being as the Apoſtle ſheweth Gal. 5. fruites of the ſpirit, they will breake forth, as through the power of him that worketh them in vs, ſo to the glory of him that vouchſafed them vnto vs: not onely to the praiſe of his own name, but ſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite ſpecially ſpirituall of the ſound mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie. So that we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch as teach men to doubt, they both hinder the minde from true comfort, both of the word and ſpirit eſpecially, who
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2304:121"/> hath the name of comfort giuen him in the ſcripture for this ende chiefely, and lay open not a little gappe, but a great broade way to deſparation.</p>
            <p n="7">7 In the word of God, and eſpecially in the writings of the newe teſtament, we haue many things propounded vnto vs, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the vnfallible teſtimony or pledge of the ſpirit, as 2. Cor. 1. he ſaith, <hi>that God hath alſo ſealed vs, and hath giuen the earneſt of the ſpirit into our hearts,</hi> meaning thereby ſuch a pawne and pledge of it, as doth not onely ſerue to confirme the promiſe of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe in vs, but is after a ſort powerfull in god if a man may ſo ſay, to make it irrevocable, or ſuch as cannot be called backe. and Eph. 1.13.14. he ſaith, <hi>they were ſealed vp with the holy ſpirit of promiſe vvhich is the earneſt of our inheritance:</hi> vnder which borrowed kinde of ſpeeches as of ſealing firſt, he meaneth to make a notable difference, betweene thoſe that are authenticall and thoſe that are not: &amp; after of earneſt, he would giue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that as he or they that haue giuen or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken earneſt of a bargaine, binde themſelues ſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2304:121"/> is it betwixt God and vs, See alſo Ephe. 4.30. and other places. But this doctrine of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries is flatly againſt it, which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth doubting of all and euery grace from God. But ſurely if we marke it, by theſe and ſuch like kind of ſpeeches as we may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the great care that God hath to roote it out of ms hearts, but alſo that it is not an eſie thing to be performed or conceiued: ſealing or a ſeale we knowe is wont to be put to ſuch things as we would haue others to take, for vndoubted aſſured, and that not ſo much in reſpect of him whoſe ſeale it is, as to him to whome the ſeale is giuen: as we may ſee in letters pattents of princes, in commisſion of great perſonages, in graunting of annuities penſions &amp;c. And the like may we ſay of the earneſt peny as we call it, both the one and the other being vſed to this end, that all what ſoeuer doubting or diſtruſt which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of way ariſe or fall out, might by euery good meane be remoued and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And euen ſo the ſeale of the ſpirit is ſtamped and imprinted in and vpon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, and the holy ſpirit is giuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:2304:122"/> as a pledge or earneſt penny, that ſo euery one of them might be certified and aſſured in their hearts, that the promiſes of God made vnto them, concerning his fauour, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their ſinnes, eternall life, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable and moſt certaine, and they the better ſenſed &amp; armed thereby againſt doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting and diſtruſt, which naturally cleaueth as faſt vnto them, as the skinne to the fleſh or the fleſh to the bones. And that this is ſo, namely that the ſpirit is giuen vnto them to theſe holy endes and purpoſes, you ſhall ſee it plainely propounded and prooued. Rom. 8.16. Cal. 4.6. beſides thoſe places which haue beene put downe before out of 2. Cor. 1. and Eph. 1.4. And therfore as it is ſinne and ſhame euen againſt the ſpirit of the grace, to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that teſtimony which he yeeldeth vnto our ſpirits, that we are the ſonnes of God, and is directly againſt the commandement of the Apoſtle. 1. Theſſ. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi> So this doctrine that leadeah the way and bring<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth forth ſuch beaſtly and bad effects ought to be odious and abhominable to euery man that regardeth his owne comfort, or eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2304:122"/> gods glory, or would not indeede diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the ſpirit of grace.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Beſides we knowe that both in the old teſtament before Chriſt, gaue the fathers ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments as particularly circrmciſion and the paſſeouer: and ſince in the newe teſtament God hath giuen vs the ſame for ſubſtance &amp; effect, I meane the ſacrament of baptiſme, and that of the Lords ſupper. In all which no doubt, god then laboureth and now aſſaieth, not onely to remooue the doubting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of our hearts, but alſo to confirme vs in this faith. But this doctrine of our popiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, concerning doubting doth infringe both the doctrine of the ſacraments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and the vſe of them alſo, and yet both of them are according. For it is certaine that the ſacraments themſelues, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the outward ſignes thereof, or the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble grace adioyned thereto, offered by the faith, offered to the faithfull and wrought in them by the religious vſe of them according to Chriſts inſtitution, were both ordained &amp; annexed, vnto the promiſes that god hath giuen vnto vs, concernig his grace &amp; fauour,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2304:123"/> that we might not onely haue the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally propounded vnto vs therein, as we ſee it to bee done in the publike miniſtrie of the worde eſpecially, but that by the vſe of the ſame, euerie one rigthly vſing them for the ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king awaye of doubt and diſtruſt out of his heart, might haue ſealed vp in him an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimonie of Gods mercie euerie way, ſpecially of the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, and the ſauing of his ſoule through the obedience of Chriſt, vnto whome and his merits the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments do indeed directly vs, and to haue by them as it were by certen aides &amp; propps his faith more &amp; more vpheld &amp; continued. And therefore Rom. 4. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of circumciſion ſaieth, <hi>that it was the ſeale of righteouſneſſe which is by faith.</hi> And Gal 5. ſpeaking of our holy baptiſme, he affirmeth <hi>that ſo many of vs as haue beene baptized ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts inſtitution, and haue had with all the grace of the Sacrament beſtowed vpon vs, by the effectuall working of the holie ſpirite of God haue put on Chriſt.</hi> Yea the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts and Paule himſelfe ſhewing what Chriſt did and ſaide in the adminiſtration of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2304:123"/> his holie Supper, obſerue amongeſt other things this that he ſaid, <hi>take yee, eate yee, this is my bodie which is giuen for you:</hi> &amp; likewiſe of the cup, <hi>drinke yee all of this, for this is my blood of the new testament, which was ſhed for you for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this particular ſumption or taking of the elements in the one or in the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to teach and inſtruct vs that as veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as thoſe outward things are become ours, we hauing taken them vpon our fleſh, in our hands, conueied them into our ſtomack, and haue had as it were al our ſenſes ſatisfied ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that ſo for our better aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we haue by the eye of faith beheld, and by the hand of faith laye ſure hold of thoſe ſpirituall graces, that God in the Sacraments ment to offer, &amp; by thoſe outward and viſible ſignes and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and actions vſed in and about them, he ment more and more to confirme our harts. But this certaintie and comforte that is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid in ſort and ſenſe is contained in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this doctrine of doubting that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the romiſh ſynagogue, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaken it, but laboureth if not by violence,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2304:124"/> yet by fraude and ſubtiltie to pull out of mens minds and conſciences. For theſe two things, to wit that in the Sacraments of God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by god, to remooue our doubting and to confirme our faith, euerie one of vs haue the promiſe of God ſealed vp in our hearts, &amp; by the Sacraments, and in their lawfull &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vſe are euerye one of vs vnderpropped and confirmed that we ſhould not doubt, but ſhould bee aſſured of the grace and fauour of God touching the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes and eternall ſaluation, and this that the papiſts teach, that we are to doubt concerning the promiſe of gods grace and fauour, pardoning of our ſinnes, ſauing of our ſoules &amp;c. Theſe two things I ſay are ſo oppoſite one of them to another, that they cannot ſtand together, nor no more agree then fire and water, light and blindneſſe &amp;c. And therefore alſo we are to caſt away from vs this doctrine or dotage rather.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As in the articles of our faith we ſay we beleeue and confeſſe, <hi>the forgiueneſſe of ſinns,</hi> ſo is that ſweet and comfortable doctrin alſo commended vnto vs in the holy Scriptures,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2304:124"/> and propounded in many places of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: take one for all namely Luke 44. where it is ſaid <hi>that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould bee preached in Chriſts name among all nations.</hi> But this doctrine of our aduerſaries fighteh directly againſt it, for ſhall we ſay we beleeue it: and yet ſhall we doubt of it? Or mindeth God to haue it propounded as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of the goſpell, and we ſhall ſtand in mannering of it, ſpecially as in reſpect of our ſelues. For other mens hearts this way we are not able to ſound: with our owne we ought to be beſt acquainted. This is to make God to deale worſe with the faithfull, then earthly princes doe with their rebellious and vnduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubiects: who if they proclaime once a pardon, muſt be beleeued in the word of a prince: and God publiſhing ſuch a doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and requiring beleefe of it, yea labouring the feeling of it in our hearts muſt not be credited. What is it to beleeue the forgiunes of ſinnes? namely to be well aſſured of this that that grace is not onely imputed vnto others, but vnto them alſo, and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo why we ſay I beleeue, and why the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2304:125"/> ſpirit telleth vs the iuſt ſhall liue by his owne faith. For though I may yea ought to be well perſwaded, as of the whole body of the Church, ſo of euery ſeueral ſounde mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, that all the graces that God hath promiſed to all or any of them ſhalbe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually accompliſhed, becauſe he that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not lie, and is both willing and able to performe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him hath promiſed the ſame: yet can I not particularly feele theſe graces in others, as in mine owne ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue receiued the gift and grace of faith particularly to apply them vnto myſelfe and to aſſure mine owne heart therein. And therefore in vaine if our aduerſaries doctrine be true, hath God both appointed the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of it, and called for the beleefe of it at our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, ſith to doubt of this maine point, is amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a matter both lawful &amp; neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Laſtly there are many places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which exact and demaunde at the hands of the faithfull perſeuerance in well doing, yea which doe exerciſe and ſtirre them vp therevnto. To put downe the particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces intreating thereof, and demaunding it at
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2304:125"/> our hands, would make halfe a volume. That we muſt auoid to the end we muſt ſhunne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes and not to ſhew ſome, were to leaue ſcruple that we could not performe it, or that there were no ſuch places in the Scripture: we muſt therefore of necesſitie repeat one or two, which I would pray the godly reader might ſuffice for all. How ſweet is that ſaying of Pſal. 37. ver 24. 25 <hi>Though he fal,</hi> ſpeaking of the righteous and godlie <hi>yet ſhall he not bee cast off</hi> And why ſo? the ſpirite rendreth the reaſon, <hi>for the Lord putteth vnder his hand:</hi> as if he would ſay, men may bee ſure it ſhall ſo be, becauſe God that is greater then all, can &amp; will eſtabliſh him. And yet there is not all, but for our better warrantile and vpholding of our heart, he putteth downe his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular obſeruation and experience not onely in his own perſon but in others, ſaying in the next verſe, <hi>I haue beene yong and am old, yet ſaw I neuer the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeede begging bread.</hi> In the 22 of the Goſpell after Luke, Chriſt ſaith thus to Peter, <hi>Simon, Simon, Satan hath deſired you</hi> (he ſpeaketh of all the faithfull vnder one mans perſon, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2304:126"/> the perſon of his diſciples) <hi>to win now you a wheat:</hi> a hard and a heauy ſentence. But yet it moſt comfortablye followeth in the nexte wordes. <hi>But I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile not.</hi> Which thing he hath done alſo euen for the reſt of the faithfull as well as for him, as we may perceiue by that worthie praier of our Sauiour Chriſt, mentioned in the 17. of Iohn and made to that end alſo. In the Romaines howe many comfortable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are there. In the 8. chap. he ſaith: <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor powers nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhallbe able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord.</hi> And in the 11. <hi>the gifts &amp; calling of God, are without repentance, or ſuch as he can neuer repent of.</hi> And in the 14. <hi>vvho art thou that condemneſt an other mans ſeruant? he ſtandeth or falleth to his owne maiſter: yea he ſhallbee eſtabliſhed for God is able to make him ſtand.</hi> Now if that popiſh point either of doubting or faling away were true, then theſe places proouing plainely that great pointe of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2304:126"/> finall perſeuerance ſhould be falſe, &amp; ſo ought not onely themſelues to be blotted out of the Bible, but the credit of the whole Scriptures to be cracked, for if it be not found true in all and euery part of it, it is not to be receiued. But I ſay let God be true, and euerie man elſe a lier: and let all fleſh giue glory to God, and ſtay the heart of it from thinking, &amp; reſtraine the mouth from ſpeaking, where God hath giuen vs ſuch a plaine and peremptorie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we haue ſhewed, ſpecially in this laſt part of the tractate, that this popiſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning doubting is directly &amp; flatly contrarie to the Scriptures, that it doth abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh faith in Chriſt, for what neede we regard faith if doubting be allowable? that it doeth fruſtrate the commandements and promiſes of God, for to what end elſe hath he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that he might beleeue and obey: that it doth reproue God of a lye, who in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed will by his word hath told and taught vs the contrarie: that it abuſeth Chriſts merit who therefore appeared that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the deuill, and amongeſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2304:127"/> the reſt diſtruſt &amp; doubting that it doth tread vnder foote, the office of the holy Ghoſt which is appointed to ſeale vp Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our hearts: that it doth weaken the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments themſelues, which are therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed, for the confirming and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of vs in faith: yea it aboliſheth and taketh away al comfort: for howe can we be cleared ſo long as our hearts be poſſeſſed with feare and doubting. And therefore beeing directly againſt the ſcripture and bringing forth ſuch badde effect, it cannot be true or good, and not being true, it is to be reiected. And ſo we might end for this point our treatiſe, were it not that ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e good men deſire to ſee the iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſonder diuines, ſpecially of former ages.

VVherein firſt for this and all other his ſuggeſtions let vs mark, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2304:134"/> he ſpeaketh the trueth, yet he doth it not with a true minde: neither in the ſame aymeth at a true or right ende.

Howbeit, they are there deliuered by God with one affection, and to one end, &amp; hereby Satan preſſed &amp; vrged, with another minde and to another end. God reuealeth the with a minde to humble men in themſelus, in their owne corruption, that ſo they might be exalted through his goodnes. But Sathan ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out their ſinne, with a hart &amp; purpoſe to ſwallow them vp with diſtruſt &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This if we know not being deceiued through the outward ſhew &amp; appearance of truth we ſhal eaſily be ouerthrown: but if we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; beleeue it, it ſhallbe ſo far off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurting vs, that it ſhall rather te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to our furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the faith of gods mercies, &amp; to the feeling of our vnworthines, that ſo we may haue iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay of our ſelues, <hi>that where ſin hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded there grace hath ouer abounded alſo.</hi> But more particularly to aunſwer, the ſeueral parts of this ſubtle ſillogiſme of Satan. For the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2304:135"/> propoſition we anſwer by diſtinction, or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as we may ſay. <hi>He that is a ſinner is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthy to be ſaued, yea moſt vvorthy euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly to periſh.</hi> This is true we confeſſe it, if we conſider man in himſelf, or in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or as he perſiſteth &amp; remaineth, or vnles he haue through the ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; obedience of Chriſt, his ſinnes pardoned: becauſe in the 1. we know our ſinns withhold good things from vs, and make a ſeparation betwixt god and vs, and wee are by nature the children of wrath as other men. And in the ſecond we are ſure, that the righteouſneſſe, ſatisfaction and obedience of Chriſt being of infinite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is able powerfull and ſufficient inough to alter the ſtate and condition, becauſe Chriſts ſatisfaction, and the worthineſſe of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, is in ſuch ſorte imputed to euerie one that beleeueth, that it is accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; indeed be come his own. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the aſſumption or minor, I ſaye for my ſelfe in particular that I am not ſuch a one, as thou Satan ſaiſt I am: for my nature is changed, &amp; I haue in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure put of the old man, and am renued into knowledge, acccording to the image of him
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2304:135"/> that hath created me: &amp; ſo alſo haue my ſinnes through Chriſts obedience bin defaced blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, &amp; ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euen before god in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of righteouſnes, as though I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tranſgreſſed. Therefore though I will not deny but in reſpect of my ſelf I am vnworthy to be ſaued, and indeede moſt worthy to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and therefore may truely ſay as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth Pſal. 143.2. <hi>Enter not into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thy ſeruant for in thy ſight ſhall none that liueth be iuſtified.</hi> Yet in Chriſt &amp; for Chriſts ſake, who is the onely beloued of God, and in whome alone the father is well pleaſed, who alſo hath abſolutely ſatisfied the wrath of God and anſwered for me, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer was againſt me, ſure I am, I am worthy to be ſaued, and vtterly vnworthy to periſh or to be caſt away. The reaſon is becauſe Chriſts worthynes, which is moſt perfect &amp; pure is imputed vnto me, and is indeede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mine as effectually, (yea I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more effectually, by howe much he is more excellent and effectuall then my ſelfe, though I were neuer ſo innocent and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) as if I my ſelfe fulfilled all righteouſnes.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2304:140"/> For this I am ſure of, looke what Chriſt did he did it not for himſelfe, for he ſtood in no need of any ſuch obedience, becauſe he neuer tranſgceſſed, but accompliſhed it for me, and for my ſaluation, and therefore I may in my meaſure ſafely ſay as the Apoſtle doth Gal. 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, but I liue, yet not I any more but Chriſt liueth in me, and in that that I novve liue in the fleſh. I liue by the faith in that ſonne of God: who hath loued me and hath giuen himſelfe for me.</hi> Which indeede is the euerlaſting and vnmooueable voice of the Goſpell, that being conuerted to God I might aſſuredly reſolue this with my ſelfe, that I ſhall for Chriſt Ieſus ſake my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour and redeemer be certainly receiued into fauour, and for his worthineſſe (though not for any of mine owne, for indeede I haue none, but all vnworthineſſe) and accepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. In confidence whereof alſo, I can in ſome ſort and ſenſe ſay for my ſelfe &amp; others, as the holy prophet of God Daniel doth, chapter 9. <hi>we doe not preſent our ſupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s before thee for our righteouſneſſe: but for thy great and tender mercies:</hi> yea heare vs
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2304:140"/> for the Lords ſake.</p>
            <p>It may be that notwithſtanding this full &amp; fit anſwere Satan (who goeth about continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally like a roaring Lion, ſeeking alwaies to deuoure vs) will not giue ouer to preſſe vs further ſaying, he that is exceedinly iuſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or will not leaue thing vnpuniſhmed, but will haue his iuſtice fully and wholly ſatisfied. But God is exceedingly iuſt, and a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous reuenger and puniſher of all ſinnes, yea his iuſtice is altogether vnchangeable. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will leaue nothing vnpuniſhed, but will haue his iuſtice abſolutely ſatisfied, and will caſt thee away, not comformable to his iuſtice.</p>
            <p>To this we may aunſwere in ſome ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the obiection touching the greatneſſe and grieuouſnes of our tranſgresſions. He preſſeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs Gods iuſtice, not with a mind that he hath to commend it, for he rather condemneth it, and all other good things in God, euen as he doth the dietie it ſelfe, but of a purpoſe to ouerwhelme vs and ſwallow vs vp therewithall, if it may be. But why may not we in ſome ſort, ſpeake to Satan in this
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2304:139"/> behalfe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as God ſhall ſpeake to the wicked his imps: <hi>What haſt thou to doe to declare my ordinances, that thou ſhouldſt take my couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in thy mouth?</hi> or why may we not ſay vnto him, aſſaulting our ſelues, or tempting others and labouring thereby to let the good work of the Lord in vs. <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>than, euen the Lord that hath choſen Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem reprooue thee.</hi> Is not this a brand take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the fire? But we ſay more particularly. He that is exceedingly iuſt will haue his iuſtice ſatisfied, either by them themſelus that ſhould doe it, and happily are not able, or els by ſome other that are fit for the purpoſe or worke. That God is exceedingly iuſt no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. His nature proueth it vnto vs, and his word propoundeth the ſame. He looketh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that his iuſtice ſhould be abſolutely ſatisfied why it is done: and that not by ſuch a one as I haue appointed for the purpoſe: for it might be he might be miſliked, as well by reaſon of my blindeneſſe to make choiſe, as by reaſon of my partiality to preferre one in mine own cauſe: but by ſuch a one as he himſelfe hath ſanctified and ſet apart for that purpoſe, that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2304:139"/> is the imaculate and vnſpotted lambe of God Chriſt Ieſus: who is become not onely my baile and ſurety, and is made a fit Mediatour betwixt me and God but hath fully paid my debt alſo in ſo much that there is not a mite behind, but al is ſatisfied and the debt booke or obligation cancelled. He hauing in my name, and as it were for my ſake offered and preſented himſelfe before God the father, to be puniſhed for my tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgresſions, yea he was broken for our iniquities, the chaſtiſment of our peace was vpon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. And the Apoſtle ſaith Rom. 3. <hi>That God hath ſet him forth to be a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation through faith in his bloode, to declare his righteouſnes by forgiuenes of ſinnes that are paſſed</hi> And in another place <hi>he hath made him that knewe no ſinne,</hi> to wit our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>to be ſinn for vs that we through him might be made the righteouſnes of God.</hi> Beſides al this I ſay Sathan, that ſith God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly iuſt, it cannot ſtand with his iuſtice (which neither willeth or can will any thing that is vniuſt) that one and the ſelfe ſame debt ſhould be twiſe paide. Men in the world, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2304:136"/> carry any account or conſcience of their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, will not doe or deale ſo groſſely. And therefore doubtleſſe it is farre off from the iuſt iudge of all the world: yea it ſhould be quite and cleane contrary, yea manifeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning with his moſt abſolute and vpright iuſtice, which Chriſt indeede by an infinite obedience vnto his maieſtie, hath aunſwered vnto God, for all my ſinnes, of which if any man ſhould doubt, let him but for his better ſatisfaction and ſtay therein, conſider theſe places of ſcripture Rom. 5. the Apoſtle ſaieth, As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by that obedience of that one ſhall many alſo be made righteouſe. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine Romans 8. verſe 1. <hi>These is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus</hi> and verſe 34. of that chapter: <hi>vvho ſhal condemne? it is Chriſt which is dead, yea or rather which is riſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of God, and maketh requeſt likewiſe for vs.</hi> &amp; Gal. 3. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed vs from the curſe of the lavve, beeing made a curſe for vs.</hi> And 1. Pet. 3. <hi>Chriſt hath once ſuffered for ſinners, the iuſt for the vniuſt.</hi> And therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2304:136"/> be that my ſinnes ſhould again come into reckoning before God, ſith that by the blood of Chriſt they are quite done away and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out as the Apoſtle ſheweth in the 2. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Epiſtle to the Coloſſ. And ſith I knowe this ſeruice and honour is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto God namely to beleeue the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes of his Goſpell. I may neither accuſe god of a lie, for that were blaſphemy, be being the onely trueth indeede, nor contemne my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour and his obedience, which I knowe to be euen as himſelfe abſolute and perfect. And one of theſe two I muſt needs doe, if I ſhould yeeld to this ſuggeſtion of Sathan.</p>
            <p>But it Sathan will proceede and ſay (for ſuch a wrangling and cruell aduerſarie will hardly be anſwered) Thou notwithſtanding all this, art ſubiect to many afflictions in this life, and in the end to death alſo, therfore god hath not pardoned thy ſinnes: but is ſtil angry with thee, for afflictions and death entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world by meanes of ſinne, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede tokens of the wrath and diſpleaſure of god, as the Apoſtle ſheweth Rom. 5.12. and Eph. 5.16.</p>

            <p>I aunſwere and reply againe, that though afflictions and death did at the firſt through ſinne enter into the world, for indeede had not ſinne beene none of them had euer fallen out: and though in their owne nature ſtill, they cannot but bring forth the like ſowre fruits &amp; bitter effects, that yet nowe through the power of God, that bringeth light out of darkneſſe, and through the ſpirit of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion in his ſeruants, whome he exerciſeth with ſuch afflictions and calamities they doe not alwaies ſort to this effect. For firſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, god in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this, either to puniſh vs as a ſeuere iudge or to condemne vs for our ſinnes, no more then a father mindeth when he chaſtiſeth his child to caſt him away, but as a moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God and louing father he doth it, either to try vs, that ſo by that meanes our faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, conſtancy, and other good fruites in it might be made known in the world, as it is manifeſted in the hiſtory of Iob and other holy mens examples, and appeareth by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of ſcripture, and namely Iames 1. where the ſpirit ſaith, brethren count it excee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding

               </gap>we that he hath not abſolutly accompliſhed? Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his very enimies he hath ſo hartily &amp; perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued, that he hath not only prayed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as appeareth in the hiſtory of his death, but alſo for numbers of them hath ſuſteined the wrath &amp; indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, that ſo he might reconcile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his heauenly father. Oh how ſweet not onely for the proofe of this point, but for the heart &amp; conſcience of all faithful is that of the Apoſtle Ro. 5. God ſetteth out his loue towards vs, <hi>that whileſt we were yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt died for vs. Much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being nowe iuſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrath through him. For if when we were eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vve were reconciled to God by the death of his ſonne, much more being reconciled, vve ſhallbe ſaued through his life.</hi> And this abſolut righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, is through Gods goodneſſe imputed vnto me, and by faith laid hold of and applied to my ſelfe, with which being clothed as with the precious and ſweet garmentes of my elder brother, I cannot but pleaſe God, and ſtande righteouſſe in his
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2304:145"/> light, as the brother of Chriſt, yea as one of gods heirs, yea &amp; which is more an heire an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed with Chriſt himſelfe. And therefore may truely &amp; comfortably ſay as the Apoſtle doth in the ſame place of Ro. 8. <hi>Hath not God ſpared his owne ſonne, but giuen him for vs al to death? how ſhall he not with him giue vs all thinges alſo? If all things, vvhy not then alſo abſolute righteouſnes? who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of gods choſen? It is god that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth vvho ſhall condemne &amp;c.</hi> as followeth moſt comfortably.</p>
            <p>Yea but it may bee, that Sathan will yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vrge this pointe: what can another mans righteouſnes auaile or profit thee? ſeeing that the law preſſeth this vpon thee, <hi>thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour &amp;c. Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours houſe &amp;c.</hi> And the Scripture tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth that ſhall die the death.</hi> Ezec. 18. And again: <hi>there ſhall be wrath and indignation vpon euerye ſoule of euerie man that doth euill and breaketh the law.</hi> Ro. 2. verſ. 9.</p>
            <p>To this we aunſwere though that which hath beene ſaid before, concerning the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:2304:145"/> of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of it may ſerue for an aunſwer, yet we further adioyne and ſay. It is true that law doth require of euery man his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, or hauing failed his ſatisfaction. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sathan is not a lyer: but this is it that he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the end of vrging this, not of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in himſelfe for ſurely he knoweth it, but of malice againſt vs, to bring vs if it could bee to death and damnation. What is the ende why the law requireth it, or God in his lawe doth demaund the ſame. It is to intimate, that there is or can be in vs anye ſuch thing? no verily: but to cauſe vs to go out of our ſelues, and to ſeeke it elſe where, where it may be found. And in this reſpect particularly amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other is it, that the law is and may be ſaid, to be ſchoolemaiſter to bring vs and to guide vs to Chriſt. And indeede this is a miſterie, which beeing either manye ages together much hidden, or elſe not ſo plainely diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as now it is, is laid open and reueiled vnto vs by the goſpell: to wit, that where mankind was not able to ſatisfie in his own perſon the law of God, and yet the law might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2304:146"/> or ouerthrowne. God hath made a tranſlation of the lawe into another perſon, which might doe that for mankinde that it could neuer performe for it ſelfe, that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely obſerue yea and fullfill the whole lawe. Which perſon becauſe it conſiſteth of two natures, the godhead and the manhood, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is his obedience an abſolute and full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſinnes of all the world, euen as it is plainely ſaid. 1. Ioh. 2. <hi>He is the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſinnes, and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world,</hi> meaning it of the efficacie of Chriſts death in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and abſoluteneſſe of it, as in regard of it ſelfe, and as in reſpect of men of al ſorts and of all ages, and all places, ſo that this benefite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the Iewes only as many might imagine but alſo to other nations. And for this cauſe is it indeed, that Chriſt is ſaid Rom. 10. <hi>to be the ende and fulfilling of the lawe for righteouſnes and ſaluation to euerie one that beleeueth.</hi> Euen as he ſaith in another place, <hi>to the Iewe firſt and alſo to the graecian, for there is no reſpect of perſons vvith God.</hi> Romaines the ſecond. And <hi>this Chriſt indeed, hath God
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2304:146"/> ſet out to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloode, that ſo we might he iuſtified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in him.</hi> To be ſhort he was by the very decre and counſel of all the perſons of the diety, ſent into the world, and made ſubiect for a while, vnto the law that he might redeeme vs from the lawe and the curſe due vnto vs contained therein, according to which the Apoſtle ſaith Gal. 4. <hi>when the fulnes of time was come God ſent his ſonne made of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; made vnder the law, that he might redeeme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were vnder it: &amp; ſo we receiue the adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſonns.</hi> Him therefore and his obedience and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when by the eye of a true and a liuely faith I looke vpon, &amp; by the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the ſame faith, I apply vnto my ſelfe, then there is nothing in the world or out of the world, be it from mine owne diffidence and diſtruſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or Satans malice, that can either accuſe me or conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne me. For I haue alwaies in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines by me, yea within me, by the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirit, out of the rich treaſure of the word, which I may oppoſe againſt all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of the lawe whatſoeuer, and by
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2304:147"/> meanes whereof I may ſtand euen in the very face and preſence of the iudgement of God, as comfortably and boldly as if I my ſelfe had in all reſpects ſatisfied the lawe of God, nay <hi>I</hi> will ſay more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortably &amp; boldly by much, by howe much God and man ioyned togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one perſon, hath for me wrought a more abſolute obedience, and righteouſnes, then I or al fleſh could haue done, had we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in our firſt eſtate of innocency and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Of which if any doubt, and would be ſatisfied for it, let him read the whole ſeuenth chapter of the epiſtle to the Romans &amp; there he ſhall finde this point confirmed, and many other ſingular matters of ſound and ſtrong conſolation propounded.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But all this notwithſtanding, Satan will obiect againſt thee, the imperfections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts that cleaue vnto thee, and thy beſt works ſaying. Though thou haue in Chriſt, a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſatisfaction made for the puniſhment of thy ſinnes, &amp; perfect righteouſneſſe: yet ſinne reſt and remaine in thee, as for example, both thy originall and many actuall tranſgresſions for which God will ſet himſelfe againſt thee.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2304:147"/> And then howe canſt thou appeare or ſtand before God the iuſt iudge of the world, yea ſuch a one as hateth all manner of filthineſſe though neuer ſo ſmale.</p>
            <p>This is a ſtrong temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I confeſſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not ſuch, but that it may be fully ſatisfied and aunſwered, by trueth out of the worde. And firſt <hi>I</hi> ſay marke this ſtill, that Sathan ſpeaketh true things, but not to a true &amp; right ende. For that we haue yet ſinne within vs, both originall and actuall, it is as cleare &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as the Suune ſhineth at noone day. But why hath god left them within vs? is it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our conſciences aboue meaſure? or in the memorie and ſight of them to throw vs downe to damnation? No verely: Sathan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſetteth them before vs to that purpoſe But God doth it to humble vs in our ſelues before him and to adde an edge vnto our ſupplications and praiers, that ſo they may be more piercing then otherwiſe. And this we may ſee in Paul, who ſaith of himſefe, that leſt he ſhould be puffed vp through aboundance or excellencie of reuelations, there was giuen vnto him a pricke in the fleſh, and Sathan as

Yea this is that that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in his owne name and of himſelfe, as alſo in the names of the regenerate and of them Rom. 7. ſaying, <hi>I alone not that which I doe, for what I would that doe I not, but what I hate that doe I If I doe then that I would not: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the lawe that it is good.

To all which we may adde for the further ſatisfaction of this dout in our hearts, and the ſtopping of Sathans mouth if it may be, that theſe our ſinnes whether they be originall or actuall, paſt or preſent, many or fewe, come not into accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or reckoning before God, neither are they neither ſhall be laid vnto our charge, the reaſon is becauſe they are omitted through the death and obedience of Chriſt, I am now through Gods goodneſſe and faith in Chriſt incorporated as it were into his body and be come fleſh of his fleſh and bones of his bones, yea as I may ſay made one with him, ſo that nowe this great grace beeing beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and I hauing that precious gift of faith wrought in me to apply it to my ſelfe, the Lord can or wil no more refuſe or condeme then Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, which I think the Apoſtle meaneth by theſe notable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſpeeches, namely Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4 And therefore the aſſault that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth againſt vs, is by an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t framed thus.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2304:151"/> Innumerable men and women periſh and are condemned, as whom Chriſt and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doth no whit at all profit: but thou art of that number as appeareth by this, becauſe thou art no whit better then they, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt rather, therefore thou art damned.</p>
            <p>Hereunto I anſwer, that the truth of this propoſition I willingly conſent vnto, namely that innumerable perſons periſh and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but yet with this exception, that the cauſe thereof is not in any impotencie or weaknes of Chriſts death and righteouſnes, for that is of moſt large, yea of infinite merit, as hath bin ſhewed alreadie: but by reaſon that they themſelues doe not beleeue. Fos as that is true in the faithfull which our Sauiour vttereth, in a moſt vehement affirmation, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ioh. 5. <hi>Verily, verily I ſaie vnto you he that heareth my word, and beleeueth in him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but hath paſſed from death vnto life.</hi> So that againe muſt be verified in the vnbeleeuers, which he ſaith els where.

For firſt when he ſaith, I am one of them, he doth not onely euill as in regard of himſelfe, taking Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vpon him, to whom alone as vengeance, ſo all true &amp; ſound iudgement appertaineth: but affirmeth falſly that which he can neuer prooue, nay the contrarie whereof I am able to ſhewe, and that not onely by mine owne iudgement, which happily might be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in mine owne cauſe, (and yet ſpeaking the truth I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould not as well be beleeued for my ſelfe as Satan againſt me) but euen from the teſtimonie and witnes of Gods holy word. I know I am faithful, and I am confirmed in the truth and certentie of the perſwaſion, becauſe I doe not in an euil or idle opinion, but in true and certen faith lay hold of Chriſt, and ſtay and ſettle my ſelfe wholly and onely vpon him. This no heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:2304:152"/> Idolater can doe, becauſe he is not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, but without God in the worlde. This no Mahometiſt or Iewe can performe, becauſe they denye him and defie him from their heartes. This no counterfeited or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt chriſtian can accompliſh. For the falſe chriſtian as papiſtes ioyne their workes at the leaſt with him: and the carnall profeſſour in the corrupt courſe of his conuerſation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies his power to mortification and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Therefore I ſeparated from all and euerye one of them, in ſtrength of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in particular application, and the fruites of faith and bleſſed obedience, cannot periſh. But maye truelye and effectuallye ſaye, that Chriſt Ieſus dwelling in my hearte and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me fruitefull to good workes, and I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine beeing thereby in him, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to me nor anye ſuch: yea I am throughly and certainelye perſwaded, <hi>That neither life nor death, heigth nor breadth, thinges preſent nor thinges to come, are able to ſeparate me from the loue of God tovvards me vvhich is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> As for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation it is apparant by
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2304:153"/> this, that though Sathan knowe vs all to bee tainted in Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet he knoweth not in whom the power of corruption preuaileth moſt or more. The wicked cannot diſcerne of them of another, no not one of them well of their hearts as we ſee euen particularly by this, that many times they are not only blind but ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe alſo: and yet a man would thinke, that they ſhould be as wel able, either to know the heigth and hainouſneſſe of one anothers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or their owne, as Sathan ſhould bee acquainted with theirs. And if Sathan cannot tell, whether I bee worſe then they, he leſſe knoweth, whether I bee in anye meaſure of mercie better then they: for by reaſon of the fulneſſe of his owne corruption, he can much better diſcerne of euill, then any whit at all of good, by reaſon of his aduerſneſſe and waye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe and vnto wardneſſe thereto. But be it as it may be, we will yeeld him the hardeſt: that I am ſuch a one to wit by nature, yet am I another man by grace and adoption, which varieth the ſtate. And though I were in my ſelfe &amp; of my ſelfe no whit better then others, nay I will ſay more, worſe then others, if god

Chriſt our Sauiour telleth vs that we ſhall know the tree by the fruite: from the effects therfore or fruits of my faith, will I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this trueth againſt thee, to the ſtaying &amp; vpholding of mine owne heart. And firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the holy ſpirit of God, and the infallible teſtimonie that it yeeldeth vnto my heart, is a principally propp and ſtay vnto me, I tell thee Sathan, that euen that ſhall teſtifie vnto my ſpirite, that I am Gods childe, and dare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon without feare or trembling, call vpon him, and ſay, <hi>Abba, O father,</hi> by which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue I doe beleeue, for otherwiſe how could I call vpon him in whome I beleeue not, and aſſuredly knowe that I haue faith, becauſe I ſtay my ſelfe wholy and onely vpon him ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him in ſome ſorte and ſenſe, as the Prophet Dauid ſaieth, <hi>Lord, vvhome haue I in heauen but thee? and in earth I deſire none vvith thee.</hi> And leaſt Sathan ſhould thinke, I doe this without warrant or reaſon, I will not feare or bee aſhamed to ſet downe my grounds out of the word. How comfortable

Cor. 2. Where he ſaieth. <hi>We haue receiued not the ſpirite of the vvorld, but the ſpirite vvhich is of God, that by it vve may know the thinges that are giuen vnto vs of God.</hi> And though this be ſufficient and indeede greater then all exception, yet haue we beſides, the powerfull working of the ſame ſpirite framing vs and faſhioning vs to ſound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion before god, and to the yeelding orbringing out of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere fruits of faith, that is to ſay good workes, which cannot but aſſure me of my ſaluation, and of Gods grace, and confirme me in the certaine hope of the one and the other. And this is that which Saint Peter prouoketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to when he ſaieth, <hi>Brethren g ue diligence by good vvorkes to make your calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure, for if yee do theſe thinges yee ſhall

If that which is from our ſelues, as for example our ſinnes maye iuſtlye mooue and make doubting, why ſhould not that which is from God, as for example, the fruits of our vnfeined faith and obedience mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtet hope and aſſurance. God I am ſure is greater then man, and his graces much more excellent, then mans infirmities are baſe and vile. And if this were not true, howe ſhould we that carrie gods heauenly treaſures in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſels, conceiue hope of profiting by them in our ſelues, or of doing good with them vnto others. But wee are aſſured of the one &amp; the other, notwithſtanding our weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and wants, therefore we muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hope of the former &amp; indeed aſſure our hearts therein. Againe, <hi>why doth Chriſt dwell in our hearts by faith</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaieth in his Epiſtle to the Epheſians? it is to this ende that he might be idle in vs? no verily. Sathan when he poſſeſſeth men will not ſuffer them
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2304:155"/> to be idle, much leſſe Ieſus Chriſt, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them ſtill to honeſt labours and good workes. For by his ſpirituall power, he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth his owne ſtrength in the middeſt of our manifold weakeneſſes. Nowe if that bee true then this enſueth therevpon, <hi>that I am Chriſts, and Chriſt is mine</hi> (as the Church &amp; faithfull ſoule ſingeth in the booke of the Canticles) yea he himſelfe with all his graces and merits whatſoeuer. So that he which fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and findeth theſe effectes in himſelfe can not but muſt of necesſitie inferre therevpon, that he hath faith, and that therefore he hath Chriſt in him, in this life, making him fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto all good works, and ſealing vp vnto him &amp; in him ſaluation &amp; euerlaſting life in that which is to come. Vnleſſe that he would imagine, that Chriſt could be idlye or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruite in the hearts of his people, which were blaſphemy. And yet we may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſured hereof, becauſe true faith indeed, can no more be ſundred from good workes, which are the ſound fruits thereof, then light from the ſunne or heat from the fire: or if you will the ſhaddow from a naturall bodie.</p>
            <pb n="274" facs="tcp:2304:156"/>
            <p>But yet Sathan will except againſt this, This faith of thine which thou ſpeakeſt of, and theſe fruites of it that thou mentioneſt, they are imperfect, they are faint and few, yea they ſeeldome or verie rarely appeare or are ſeene.</p>
            <p>What then Satan? Graunt that my faith and good works are faint and few in me: wilt thou infer that therefore I haue none? that is againſt all reaſon and religion. In reaſon he that hath but a ſick, pining or languiſhing life, liueth ſtill, and in hope of the bettering of his eſtate, either as in regard of this world, if god will, or as in reſpect of the life to come eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. And why ſhoulde not this in meaſure and manner be true, as in reſpect of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life here. In religion, we know that God accepteth both the whole Church, &amp; the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of it, according to that they haue and not according to that they haue not, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided alwaies: that that which they haue they haue it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: or els how could the Church &amp; members of it reioyce or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelus in the thing that they do. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that we learne notwithſtanding weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2304:156"/> wants either in whole congregations or ſeue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall members not to breake the vnitie of the ſpirit in the band of peace, nor to forſake the fellowſhip of the brethren, and the exerciſes of the Church, as the manner of ſinne is, but n holy wiſdome and power from aboue: to put a difference betwixt good and euill, and that not onely in our perſwaſion, but in our practiſe, not forſaking the good of our God for ſome euills or corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man adioined therewithall, nor yet for the goods ſake, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying or approouing the euill. And if this were not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t yet we haue further props to our faith here, namely firſt that though our faith be weake and faint, yet is it true and ſound. For euen that faith which is infirme and weake, may yet notwitſtanding be true &amp; right, the reaſon is becauſe that not weake faith and true faith are oppoſite, but weake faith and no faith. And this we may ſee alſo, by the worthy ſpeech of the father of the ſicke childe in the Goſpell: <hi>Lord I beleeue: but helpe thou mine vnbeleefe.</hi> This weakenes &amp; imperfection our faith not comming from
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2304:157"/> it ſelfe, nor being in it ſelfe as of it ſelfe, for ſo it is an excellent and an abſolute worke of God, but as it is intermingled with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of our vnbeleeuing heart which yet notwithſtanding the faintneſſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of it, may no leſſe effectually, as in regard of the particular perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing it apply Chriſt with all his benefits vnto himſelfe, then a faith that happily is more firme and ſteadfaſt, though in regard of it owne particularly, it may be it doth leſſe firmely apprehend the ſame, and yet the party hauing no leſſe good or comfort thereby: as in reſpect of his owne particular, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> he that ſeemeth to haue a more firme faith. For euen as in the foode of the body, a poore mans bread and water as we ſay, maketh him haue as ſtrong a body, as the beſt dainties in the world doe the rich, ſo is it herein: or to ſpeake more plainely. As a man or woman that is ſicke of a fainting or languiſhing diſeaſe, doth receiue ſometimes more comfort, by many meane meates then thoſe that haue the cordiall and reſtoratiue things: euen ſo may a mans weake faith in the ſoundneſſe of it, yeeld him as ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2304:157"/> as he that hath moſt ſtrength and might that way. And no doubt but God will haue it to be ſo, to the ende that as we knowe that in the body to be which the Scripture ſaieth, <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely but by euery good worde that proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> ſo we might much more effectually know our ſpirituall life to be vpheld by him, who in the daies of our diſtreſſes as in regard of famine weakeneſſe &amp;c. maketh his might manifeſt in the mideſt of our infirmities. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I aunſwere further, that that which is languiſhing in my ſelfe, is yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in Chriſt my Sauiour firme and altogeather perfect and abſolute, for the further aſſurance of my heart wherein Chriſt giueth and impu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth vnto me, whatſoeuer he as my Mediator hath acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed before God, or hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: which is not or cannot be weake, and therefore I alſo cannot miſcarry. And ſith by the vſing of all good and holy meanes, I daily indeauour that my faith may be ſtronger &amp; ſtronger, and particularly daily offer vp my ſupplications to God, that he would increaſe it in me, and kindly in me alſo a more earneſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2304:158"/> flame of the holy loue, I am ſure that I ſhall find theſe fauours, becauſe he that cannot lie and giueth aboundantly to euery one that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, &amp; yet vp brayeth none therewith hath promiſed me in his Goſpell <hi>that to him that asketh ſhalbe giuen, and to him that hath ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be giuen more, and he ſhal haue aboundance.</hi> Mat. 13. And for my better incouragement herein, I ſet before me the examples of Gods Saints, who though they did fall moſt fouly and grieuouſly, did not for all that ceaſe to call vpon God of whome alſo they were graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly heard: and why? not becauſe of their ſinnes for ſinne it ſelfe ſeperateth betwixt god and man, but becauſe they were of his owne free grace, reckoned in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his ſonns and ſeruants. And therefore I may conclude as of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo of my ſelfe: that though our faith be weake and fraile as it is in al fleſh, yet I may be aſſured of theirs, and mine owne ſaluation eſpecially. And the reaſon is becauſe the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenty of life euerlaſting ſtandeth not ſo much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity greatnes, &amp; excellency of my faith, as vpon the power, good wil, &amp; fidelity of God, that in Chriſt was pleaſed to elect me
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2304:158"/> to it, and to beſtowe it vpon me. And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for faith, I may truly ſay thus, that if I haue but one only ſparke or crumme of faith, by a manner of ſpeeech, ſo that it be right and true: it is ſufficient to aſſure me of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of my ſinnes and of eternall ſaluation: &amp; whatſoeuer is in or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; for Chriſts ſake to be communicated vnto me. And this I ſay not onely for my preſent feeling, but alſo for that which is paſt: though preſently it may be I perceiue it not. For euen for the graces paſt we may and we ought to be aſſured of ſaluation and all other fauours from God, the reaſon whereof is rendred in the ſcriptures as namely Rom. 9. where the Apoſtle affirmeth <hi>that the gifts and callings of God are ſuch as cannot be repented of,</hi> and againe the firſt of Iohn and the third verſe <hi>the ſeed of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of God remaineth in vs: by which we ſee all firmely,</hi> concerning this matter all is attributed to God and his graces and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to our ſelues: which if we ſhould not beleeue it were not onely diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable to our ſelues, but blaſphemous againſt God Laſtly againe we ſay that in this ſuggeſtion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2304:159"/> Sathan reaſoneth: againſt vs as if in worldly things a man ſhould frame an argument thus there appeareth no flame: therefore there is no fire. In winter trees beare neither leaues nor fruit: therefore they haue no life in them: but of reaſoning this kind we would be ſo farre of from liking, that we would rather hiſſe at it. For we knowe fire may be where no flame breaketh forth, as in a flint for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or vnder the aſhes &amp;c. And the like may we ſay of trees, which we are ſure haue life in them, though they ſeeme to be deade in the winter ſeaſon. And why may we not affirme the ſame of Gods graces in vs, which howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be ouerſhadowed with the aſhes of our corruption, or nipped ſomewhat or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen backe to the roote, through the froſt and cold of infirmities that we carrie about with vs, ſhall yet notwithſtanding breake forth, budde, and beare better then euer before, that ſo that may be true in vs, that is ſaide in the Pſal. 92. <hi>Such as be planted in the houſe of the Lord ſhal floriſh in the courts of our God. They ſhal bring forth fruite in their age, they ſhall be fat and floriſhing to declare that the Lord

               </gap>e Sathan the antecedent to be true. And yet I muſt tell thee by the way, that the very time of my calling is ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etimes vnknown and vnfelt in my ſelfe, and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though thou art vnacquainted with it. But ſuppoſe that were true, yet that would not followe, that thou wouldeſt inferre. For it is not a late calling, that may hinder me, but gathering by ſound effects that certenty of mine owne ſaluation, but either no calling at all which is the ſtate of infinite numbers of people in the world, I meane by the publike miniſtry of the word, or els an vneffectual cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling, that being vneffectual, not onely becauſe God is not pleaſed to make it powerfull, but alſo becauſe men either in their carnall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2304:160"/> or prophan contempt, make it vnpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull and vnprofitable to themſelues alſo. Shall we ſay in common ſpeach, and that by the light of nature, the way to good manners is neuer to late. And ſhall we preſcribe, time, meane, matter, or any thing els to the almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie: God is able and will alſo at what time &amp; howe it pleaſeth himſelfe, to call his owne, &amp; my ſelfe amongſt the reſt. He calleth ſome ſooner: and yet their ſtate not much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that: and ſome later and yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition not much the worſe for that; which our Sauiour himſelfe declareth in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them, that were called at diuers time; to worke in his vyneyard. Mat. 20. where thoſe that were called at the dawning of the day, and at the third, ſixt, &amp; ninth houre, they murmured at this, that they came at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth houre, receiued as much as themſelues; which had borne the burden and heat of the day. But what ſaith the Maſter of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, <hi>Friends I haue done you no wrong, take that which is your owne, goe your waies, I will giue vnto this laſt, as much as vnto you.</hi> And why doth he ſo? but that we might ſee that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2304:160"/> to be true in himſelfe, which he ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>he will haue mercie on whome ſoeuer he will haue mercie,</hi> and that in ſuch a meaſure of mercie to, as he &amp; not they ſhal thinke beſt: yea he doth it to this end, that we might finde that fulfilled in the world amongſt his owne, that he promiſeth in his worde, <hi>that vvhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it pleaſeth him to ſhew mercy he vvill.</hi> Yea and that that might be verified, which followeth in the end of the parable, <hi>the</hi> 1. <hi>ſhall be laſt &amp; the laſt firſt.</hi> Nay wee will ſay more then this. Euen in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are called late as we ſay, ther are or do appeare many times more euident teſtimonies of faith &amp; ſaluation, then in thoſe that are called ſomewhat ſooner. For ouer &amp; beſides that wee may ſay nothing of this, that many forward at the firſt do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold ſlowly on, but ſometimes ſlippe back, the very work it ſelfe, and the plenty of grace that is ſhedde abroad into their heartes doth plainely ſhew, that God alone, and not man or meane hath wrought the thing, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al the glory therof, as likewiſe thanks for it to be returned vnto him, wheras if it were a worke of great continuance, wee woulde
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2304:161"/> or might ſeeme to aſcribe it partly to length of time, and partly to ſome other inſtruments or meanes vſed in the effecting thereof. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man doubt of this, let him looke vpon the example of one of the theeues, that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt. Oh what a heauenly and holy ende made he, and that not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking euill in his lewd and wicked compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: neither yet in iuſtifying the innocencie and cleareneſſe of our Sauiour, but in calling vpon him and that from the bottome of his heart for mercie. All which and ſpecially this laſt, are full of ſingular grace in regard of god, and maruelous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſorte in reſpect of vs. From whence alſo me thinke we may inferre, that whoſoeuer he bee that doeth but in the verie pinch of death, feele theſe holy and heauenlie motions he may certainely aſſure himſelfe, of infallible teſtimonies of faith, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent alſo of eternall ſaluation; becauſe faith and euerlaſting life, are neuer ſundred in gods children for the feeling of it in this life, and the fruition of it, in that which is to come. And if in my death the feeling of theſe motions may yeeld me ſpirituall &amp; heauenly comfort, why
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2304:161"/> ſhould they not alſo miniſter vnto me ſtrong conſolation, at what time ſoeuer in my life, god of his owne bountifull liberality, maketh me a plentifull partaker thereof. Beſids all this, Sathan, that hath beene ſaid, I muſt and will tell thee one thing further, not onely for the full confutation of that which thou obiecteſt, but euen for the throwinge of thine owne dongue and filthineſſe into thine owne face. For howſoeuer in other things thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe to bee a moſt ſubtill aduerſarie, yet therin I will from thy ſelfe take that, that ſhall hinder me from yeelding, if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. Is there any thing more groſſe in the world then poperie which thou haſt hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and brought forth to behold this light? Amongſt poperie, is there any pointe more deteſtable then that of mans merits? Doth not this thy temptation openly vnder proppe and ſhore vp the ruinous bulwarke or buttereſſe? If for the length of my calling I ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ſhoulde not God bee mooued with worldly reſpects? For my very calling it ſelfe though neuet ſo effectuall, I am not reſpected but for gods free fauour and laſt caſt vpon me
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2304:162"/> in Chriſt: and therefore not for the length of time wherein I am called. For I may reaſon of my calling, as I doe of other graces of god. The faith that God hath wrought in me, is an excellent grace, and indeede the hand as it were to lay hold of eternall life, and yet I am not ſaued for my faiths, but for Gods mercie ſake in Chriſt Ieſus. Theſe graces of faith and feeling of vocation, ſanctification &amp;c. are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon me and wrought in me, not ſo much, nay indeed no whit at all for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of my ſaluation: for that belongeth vnto Gods mercie and Chriſts merite, as to pledge vp vnto me, the certaintie &amp; aſſurance of that and all other graces, that God is pleaſed freely &amp; of his owne accord to beſtow vpon me, &amp; other wretched that haue the gift to beleeue.</p>
            <p>But Sathan preſſeth againe this pointe, and frameth a new argument thus. Thou thy ſelfe needeſt not heare thy ſelfe ſo bolde: others that thought themſelues as ſtronge as thou doeſt thy ſelfe haue fallen away. Thou art but infirme and weake, and maieſt not onely ſlide and ſlipp, but fall away from the grace of god &amp; looſe the faith that thou haſt. Thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt not
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2304:162"/> therefore at anye hand be ſure of euerlaſting life, and the ſauing of thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>But I tell thee, Sathan, though I can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, thou ſhouldſt humble me my ſelfe, and of my ſelfe as lawe as thou canſt, and I knowe it alſo ſometimes to be needfull by reaſon of the high conceits that fleſh and blood carieth of it ſelfe yet thou ſhalt neuer take away the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me that the Lord hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, nether wil I ſuffer him to be blaſphemed that hath dealt ſo bountifully with me, no though thou ſhouldſt either in malice againſt me, or in blaſphemye againſt God, write a booke, much leſſe ſhall theſe few and weak things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow my hope. I tell thee therfore Satan, that though I bee infirme and weake in my ſelfe, and readie euerie minute of an houre to ſlippe and ſlide, yea to fall, yet I am ſtrong in him that is the roote and fortreſſe, yea the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God of my ſtrength and power: of whom I may ſay as Dauid ſaieth, <hi>by the Lord I ſhall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be inabled to leape ouer a vvall, and he ſhall ſtrengthen my hand and mine arme to breake a bow of braſſe</hi> and concerning whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towardes me. I haue that ſounding in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2304:163"/> my heart, that was anſwered to the Apoſtle. <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee, &amp; my ſtrength ſhallbe perſected through weakenes.</hi> And why ſhould I make anie doubt of this, ſith Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection (which is grounded vpon the mutable purpoſe and decree of God) is alwaies firme and ſure. And ſith the word not of man but of god aſſureth me that thoſe whome the Lord loueth, euen vnto the ende he loueth them? &amp; ſith that he that is for vs, &amp; with vs &amp; within vs is ſtronger and greater then al. And ſith eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the verie articles of our faith, teach vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as the Father to be Almightie, whoſe power no creature is able to withſtand: ſo Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be our Lord, into whoſe hands ſith the father hath eiuen vs, wee are ſure no aduerſarie power ſhall pull vs out of the ſame: for he alſo is not onely conſtant and firme as the father, but almightie alſo. And that ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he hath wrought for me through his blood, and inabled me in the power of the ſpirite to applye vnto mine owne hearte he will preſerue and vpholde in mee, together with the gift and grace of perſeueraunce, ſo that not fall euen vnto the end and in the end.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2304:163"/> Wherein I am the more ſetled &amp; confirmed not onely by this, that he dealeth not with his ſeruants as men do, who beginne and leaue of in the turning of a hand, or the twinckling of an eye, but looke what worke he beginneth in his he perfecteth the ſame. Neither yet by this, that he hath giuen me and the reſt of his ſeruantes gracious promiſes: as that he wil be with vs vnto the ende of the worlde, that his ſpirite ſhall bring vnto our remembrance, the ſweet and comfortable wordes of trueth and life, but alſo by this that he hath graciouſlye performed it vnto his ſeruants, not onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them that they haue not beene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, either with the ſwaye of ſinne in the world, or ſtrength of corruption in them ſelues, but euen then when they haue beene fallen in rayſing them vp againe, as wee ſee particularly in Dauid, who confeſſeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and in himſelfe that to bee true through gods goodneſſe, <hi>thou haſt deliuered my ſoule from death, mine eies from teares, and my feet from falling.</hi> Pſalme 116. And likewiſe in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom though our Sauiour Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of Sathans malice againſt him, and the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2304:164"/> reſt of the faithfull vnder this metaphoricall or borrowed terme of deſiring to winnowe them as men doe winnowe wheate: yet doth withall moſt comfortably tell him, and the reſt of the faithfull in him, <hi>I haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not, wherefore when thou art conuerted ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> And what though others in outward ſhewe farre better and more ſtronge then my ſelfe haue fallen awaye. Doeth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that I ſhall doe ſo likewiſe? I tell thee no Sathan. God is aboue all lawe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beyonde all example. And what if God, to let proude fleſhe and bloode vnderſtande, that they ſtande not by themſelues, woulde make ſome fearefull examples of humaine inconſtancie, weakeneſſe and waueringe, to the ende that the parties themſelues might bee humbled and other learne to feare? wilt thou then from thence gather an vniuerſall courſe? Or on the other ſide, if God for the comforte of al them that are feeble and weak hearted and handed in Sion, would make the meaneſt of his ſeruantes moſt worthye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes to manifeſte his ſtrength in their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2304:164"/> owne weakeneſſe, wilt thou croſſe his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whoſe power no creature is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? and dareſt thou diſcomfort where God goeth about to giue all conſolations, yea ſuch comforts as no man can giue but he, and none can haue but thoſe that belong vnto him? O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and beſides all this, god in his word hath giuen me other ſtrong conſolations, againſt this temptation or aſſault of thine, for in the ſecond epiſtle of Timothy and the ſecond chapter. againſt the backe ſliding and falling away of others, he giueth me theſe two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall comforts, namely that the elect, of which number I am one, are out of all danger of any ſuch falling away: and againe that ſuch hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall backſliders are knowne to god, and not to vs when he ſaith. The ſtrong founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of god remaineth ſure, hauing this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his. And in the ſecond chapter of Saint Iohns firſt epiſtle the holy ghoſt laboureth the ſame point (that ſo in the mouth of two or three witneſſes this as all other trueth might be eſtabliſhed and made ſure) and giueth ſundry conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it, as firſt that none ſhould be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2304:165"/> or offended with their faultes, becauſe though ſuch had or might haue a place in the Church, yet were they neuer of the Church, becauſe the Church is the company of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, which cannot periſh and therefore alſo cannot fall from the grace of God in Chriſt. Secondly becauſe they are annointed of the holy Ghoſt not onely with true knowledge of ſaluation and eternal life, but with all other graces from the ſame, and namely with the gift of perſeuerance, but his owne words are moſt excellent, and therefore let vs marke them. <hi>They went out from vs</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but they were not of vs, for if they had beene of vs, they ſhould haue continued with vs. But this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that it might appeare that they are not all of vs but ye haue an ointment fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy one, and knowe all things.</hi> And nowe with what reaſon or face ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Irefuſe this truth of God, ſo plainely and plentifully propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and imbrace the lies of Sathan. I tell thee I cannot fall away from the grace of god nor fall away from the faith that he hath planted in me, vnles I would make God a changeling and vncertaine: and that cannot be for the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2304:165"/> ſcripture telleth me, there is not ſo much as a ſhadow of turning in his maieſtie: which yet that I might be the better perſwaded thereof he hath alwaies by performance ſhewed him ſelfe, at all times and to all his people, to be ſuch a one. Shewe thou the contrary if thou canſt.</p>
            <p>But Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> further preſſeth this temptation, of mans weakneſſe and abilitie to fall away, from the acts indeede thereof and the effects following fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame ſaying after this ſort. <hi>Thou haſt fallen diuers vvaies and at ſundry times alſo, and therefore haſt loſt the faith &amp; grace that God gaue thee, and ſo art beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e gods enimie. Aud howe canſt thou then be aſſured of fauour at his hand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herevnto I anſwere, that I cannot or will not deny, but that I haue fallen, and fallen fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea diuers waies and ſundry times: and of this I haue better witneſſe then thy word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. For firſt that obſeruation of mine own waies, that God of his grace hath wrought in me doth teſtifie vnto me euery day when I riſe vp and euery night when I lie down, that I haue and doe heinouſly offend: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2304:166"/> the texts of holy ſcripture doth witnes the ſame, as for example. 1. king. 8. <hi>there is not a man but he ſinneth.</hi> and James 3. <hi>in many things we ſinne all.</hi> Howebeit we ſee a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelouſe difference betweene their ſetting my ſinnes before me and Gods word propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it vnto me. Thou doeſt it of a deadly malice to drawe me into deſperation, and by meanes thereof into condemnation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore no reaſon, that I ſhould liſten vnto thee, ſo deadly hating me as thou doeſt, attempting ſuch morall dangers againſt me, as the death and deſtruction of my ſoule and body, But the Lord ſetteth them before me, to humble me at the feete of his goodnes, that ſo in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing me alſo ſo greate a debt, I might learn both to loue him that hath dealt ſo bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me, and beware of falling into the like miſchiefes againe by meanes of my ſinns. Beſides I anſwere further for my ſelfe, that I am not ſo much to regard my ſlips &amp; falls, as how or with what affection I haue offended God hath kept me from ſinning preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, &amp; with a high mind, howſoeuer to make me ſee my ſelfe, &amp; to be more circumſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2304:166"/> tranſgresſion: I haue fallen of humane infirmitie and weakneſſe. And if this and ſuch like conſiderations mittigat ſinnes amongſt men, why ſhould it not alſo in ſome ſort doe ſo before God, who is better able to diſcerne and iudge both of actions and affections then all the people of the worlde that either haue beene, be, or ſhallbe. Moreouer that is falſe that thou doeſt inferre that falling into ſinne, doth vtterly ſpoile Gods people of faith in themſelues, and of all grace and fauoure from God, for if that were ſo, howe could any of gods children, that haue gone before vs, or liue preſently with vs, or which ſhall ſucceed vs euen to the ende of the world (al and euery one whereof, ſome one way ſome another, haue beene fearefully ouertaken) be raiſed vp againe to repentance and amendment of life. And this we may ſee as by many examples of holy men in the worde: &amp; in the world, ſo by the doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt. Ioh. 3. <hi>who ſoeuer is borne of god ſinneth not,</hi> that is to ſay either the ſinne that is vnto death, or lieth not wallowing ſwinelike as the vngodly of the world doe in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2304:167"/> the filth and puddle of their tranſgresſions. And of this aſſertion he rendreth a reaſon ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry ſtrong and forcible ſaying for his ſeede re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maineth in him, that is the holy ghoſt with his graces ſhed abroad into his heart, will not let him lie ſtill but laboureth his rayſing vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And as though this had not beene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, he addeth neither can he ſinne to wit in ſort as before is expreſſed and why? becauſe he is borne of God, who beſides that he is ſtronger then all, and therefore can and will performe his owne will, doth not beginne in his people any good worke, but bringeth it one daily more and more according to the meaſure that he ſeeth to be good for all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this grace I find from God, that as I ſee my ſinne for my humiliation, ſo I behold the precious gift of faith, and many great graces of God for my exaltation, and therfore haue not loſt as thou wouldſt haue me beleeue (Sathan) all ſenſe &amp; feeling of God and godlineſſe, but haue that ſeed and the annointing, by which I ſhall be inabled to ſtand, and if I doe fall ſhall yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be raiſed vp againe and ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:2304:167"/> my feete, more ſtaied and confirmed then euer before, and that not onely by reaſon of the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and meanes, that is wrought in me thereby, but alſo by the ſtrength that is communicated vnto me from aboue, which in ſucceeding time breaketh forth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am not vtterly falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from grace, as thou forgeſt and faineſt Satan: neither haue made fruſtrate Gods election concerning my ſelfe: becauſe that as a ſtrong fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation remaineth vnmoueable and vnchangeable, for he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alwaies faithfull and cannot denie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whether it be executing of his wrath vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on the wicked, or in the diſplaying and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of his mercies vpon the godly. Beſides eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from this I gather infallible comfort that hauing in a true and diligent ſearch of mine owne ſoule, but once in my life found faith in ſelfe, I cannot vtterly loſe faith and the fauour of God. And why ſo? it is becauſe I haue it? no, but becauſe the <hi>gift and callings of God are ſuch as God will neuer repent him of,</hi> Ro. 9. And vpon this and nothing els doe <hi>I</hi> aſſure my heart. Wherefore I feare not to affirme and ſay, that though my faith may be ſore
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2304:168"/> ſhaken, and euen as in regard of the fruits of it as if it were broken of for a time, or rather lie hid a little while, vntill I be inabled by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Gods bleſſed ſpirit to gather my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits vnto my ſelfe: yet <hi>I</hi> am ſure the ſeed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of remaineth in me, and ſhall againe beeing raiſed vp by the ſpirit of God breake out in as full force as before. As we may ſee firſt in Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid, notwithſtanding his fearefull falls of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, murther &amp;c. and then in Peter, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his carnall counſell, giuen to his Maſter, and his ſhamefull denying, yea ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring and forſwearing of him, in whome it lay hidden, as it were fire in or vnder the aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the ſunne vnder a darke or thicke cloud, it being ſtirred vp in Dauid by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie of Nathan the Prophet ſent vnto him by God to reprooue him &amp; put him in mind of his ſinne, and in Peter, as by the crowing of the cocke ſo by Chriſts looking backe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. So gracious is God towards his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo powerfull in his owne worke that rather then his people ſhould periſh, his mercies ſhould allure them, his iudgements ſhal terrifie them, his word ſhal humble them
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2304:168"/> yea and raiſe them vp alſo, his ſpirit ſhal draw them &amp; that which ſeemeth to be no meane ſhalbe an effectuall &amp; powerfull inſtrument to manifeſt his glory and to worke their good through Chriſt. And that this is falſe that thou ſaiſt Satan, that the faithful by their ſins looſe faith it ſelfe, and the graces of the ſpirite, may appeare by two places of Scripture. The 1. is out of Pſal. 51. where the Prophet praieth <hi>that god would not take his holy ſpirit fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</hi> Which if it had bin quite loſt by his former tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgresſion, he could not haue praied for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was gone before, but rather ſhoulde haue praied that the Lord would haue reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his holy ſpirite vnto him; becauſe taking away implieth reſtoring, and praying not to take it awaye, declareth that it was there ſtill howſoeuer in his owne feeling and falls, he ſuppoſed he had iuſtly deſerued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued thereof. The ſecond is the wordes of our Sauiour to Peter Luke. 22. ſaying <hi>I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile thee not.</hi> Which words as they containe in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Chriſts vnfeined care and loue, ſo he ſaith <hi>I haue praied for thee,</hi> ſo do they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2304:169"/> a faithful promiſe, in theſe words <hi>that thy faith faile not,</hi> or if you wil this being the end that Chriſt aimed at in his praiers, or the fruit &amp; effect that followeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all Chriſt ſhewing, that is through his moſt feruent and continual praiers, that the whole Church and the particular members of it, are ſo vpheld, that they do neuer vtterly, nor neuer ſhall vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fal away from the faith: which thing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken here as it ſhould ſeeme particularly to &amp; of <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding in truth &amp; vprightnes to be extended to all the faithfull, becauſe there is in their meaſure &amp; manner a like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them in al &amp; euery faithfull perſon, is more at large deſcribed &amp; prooued in the 17. of Iohn. Where we may ſee that Chriſts praier was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, is now, and ſhalbe to the end of the worlde, the very foundation and groundwork of the ſtability and continuance of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Another ſore aſſault, that after the former, yea and indeede at the leaſt wiſe in outward ſhew vpon the former, Satan maketh againſt vs, or giueth vnto vs is this. If thy ſinnes harm thee not, neither indeed ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt thee as thou
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2304:169"/> ſaieſt, thou maieſt after thou beleeueſt once ſinne without feare of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Thou dealeſt Sathan, like a Sathan now: &amp; that in a double reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt in the end of thy temptations, labouring euery way if it may be to ouerthrow my faith and obedience. In the former thou didſt aſſaye to drawe me to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. In this latter thou laboureſt, to throwe me headlong into ſecuritie. So that thou ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my ruine, thou careſt not by what meane by either of theſe, or by both of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by any other. God hath diſcouered this vnto me, &amp; I hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie thanke him, hoping that he that hath giuen me grace to eſpie thy ſubtletie, wil alſo graunt me ſtrength to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly herein thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe an aduerſary, in that thou doeſt falſifie &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert my words. Where did I ſay ſimply, that ſinne could not hurt or harme? This I beleeue in my heart &amp; haue and will confeſſe it vnto the end with my mouth, that being ingrafted into Chriſt, my ſinnes paſt or preſent cannot condemne me, no more then they haue done the faithfull which haue gone before me in the fleſh and in faith. And what haue I ſaide
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2304:170"/> here, but that which the Scripture ſpeaketh euery where. The Apoſtle telleth vs. Rom. 8. in termes that cannot be corrupted with falſe gloſſes, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> That againe that the ſpirit ſpeaketh out of the Prophet Ieremie as a parte and peece of the newe couenant. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes 8. tendeth to the ſame ende. ſaying: <hi>I willbe mercifull to their vnrighteouſnes, &amp; I will remember their ſinnes &amp; their iniquities no more.</hi> That our ſinnes offend our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; heauenly father, that they grieue the holy ghoſt within vs, yea that we by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not only as it were with cartrops, but with gable ropes pul vpon vs, though not eternall, yet te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary &amp; corporall puniſhments, &amp; ſo indeed do harme &amp; hurt vs, I neuer denied nor will deny, becauſe the truth and certenty of al &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of theſe things is propounded vnto vs in the worde of God. But in what ſenſe I haue ſaide thus. I haue ſhewed before, and let that ſuffiſe. As for that that thou woldſt haue me to infer thervpon, namely that therefore I might liue as I liſt, &amp; ſinne without controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is moſt falſe in it ſelf, moſt irreligious
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2304:170"/> before God &amp; moſt vnſeaſonable in the ſight &amp; iudgement of men. Doth not the Apoſtle tell vs Rom. 8 <hi>that they that are led by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit of God are the childe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> what meneth he thereby? any thing els but this that they that are by the grace of God through the worke of regeneration, in the power of the ſpirit, and the exerciſes of the word, freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne do not remaine or continue therein? And is not the ſame that he expreſſeth in an other place in other tearmes, ſaying <hi>our olde man is crucified with Chriſt that the bodie of ſinne might be deſtroyed that henceforth we ſhould not ſerue ſinne?</hi> If we knowe any thing in Chriſt or of Chriſt, we knowe this that ſo many as are iuſtified from their ſinns by faith in his blood are alſo by the ſpirit of Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified vnto obedience of his wil for theſe are the two fruits that we haue in &amp; by the death and riſing againe of our Sauiour: from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo there followeth this comfort to the faith full, that they doe many times in ſome good meaſure withſtand and ouercome ſinne, not in others only, but in themſelues principally. And ſure we are of theſe, that that ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:2304:171"/> which we haue in and from Chriſt by obedience of his will can no more be ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from free, iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from all our vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe through his blood, then heat from fire or light and warmeth from the body of the ſunne. And therefore euen this declareth, Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that thou art a falſifier of all good words and workes. But beſides I tel thee that ſith we may by effects gather arguments to our ſelus touching the ſaluation of our ſoules, that ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore thou canſt not or ſhalt not herein ſhake my faith. I take it to be the generall drift of the Apoſtle. 2. Cor. 13. to prooue that by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects we may iudge of our owne and other mens good eſtates before God. Sith therfore God giueth vs that leaue, it behoueth vs with all careful indeauour, as to vphold theſe good things in vs, ſo carefully to ſee whether we can truely finde them in our ſelues or no: or the more in number, the more great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in qualitie, and the more aſſured we ſhall after due examination finde them to be in vs: the more aſſured we may be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our owne ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo much the more valiantly oppoſe our ſelues againſt Sathat in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2304:171"/> this ſame dangerous combate. Whereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as ſeemeth to me there is great reaſon. For if our ſinnes which are from Sathans malice or our owne corruption, do grieue vs &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſe our hearts with feare why ſhall not the fruits of our faith and obedience, which are from God, yeeld vs comfort &amp; fill our hearts with hope not becauſe they are in vs, for ſo we doe many times weaken them at the leſt, if not impaire or hurt them, but as they are in vs from God, who we are ſure will accept of his owne good workes and graces vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vnto vs. Laſtly I ſay, that as we abſtaine not from meate and drinke, and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie aides of naturall life, becauſe we knowe that the tearme and time of the ſaid life is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by God: ſo there is no man, vnles he be wittingly and wilfully wicked, that therefore will giue himſelfe ouer to ſinne, becauſe he is aſſured of his owne ſaluation, for that were to turne the grace of God into wantoneſſe, &amp; to abuſe the beſt grace that euer God gaue vs, nay rather a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil therefore the more heedily beware of ſinne, &amp; abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth that ſinne in it own nature
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2304:172"/> grieueth god, &amp; make the ſeperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between the Lord and vs, and cleaue faſt vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes &amp; well doing becauſe our forſaking euill or departing from it, as alſo our accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and performance of good thinges, is a pledge of our electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>The ſtrong foundation of God remaineth ſure hauing this ſeale ſet vnto it, firſt the Lord knoweth them that are his: and ſecondly let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that calleth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of the lord Ieſus Chriſt depart from iniquitie.</hi> And there fore, I tell thee Satan, I cannot harken to any of thy voices, much leſſe to this, by which thou laboureſt to thruſt me headlong into looſe life, which wil prouoke god, hurt mine owne ſoule, and hinder other men from faith full obedience, but deteſt thee and it &amp; wil by gods grace flie from theſe, and all other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, whatſoeuer thou wouldſt ſtirre me vnto.</p>
